 introduction primo operating system part v language advanced primo material written violence copyright c void hacker  welcome fifth final part series primo operating sys tem last installment cover many aspect primo overlooked including program type execution language access control list setting editing abbreviation file use investigation thereof physical system console prime computer system acl readwrite lock used protect sad hacking older outdated revision primo useful cpl utility enhance primo reference acknowledgement epilog end series see part v  throwtogether finishitup  installment cover everything failed previous part fairly good working knowledge primo hope last installment make eager primo hacker happy enjoy  program type execution file extension listing part see many diff erent type program file extension look execute program well section start let talk cpl program cpl prime  command procedure language  like vaxvms dcl interpreted language performing rudimentary task say unable perform complicated task certainly commonly user login file cpl program usually called cpl cpl program sam type file slisted usual several method executing cpl program example assume file called voidcpl example ok cpl void ok r voidcpl first example illustrates use cpl command cpling program need include  cpl  file extension want second example see r command r really command name command abbreviation full command name resume resume requires include file extension along filename cpl pro gram located cmdnc directory execute simply ent ering name example would ok void would execute voidcpl program located cmdnc fact file located cmdnc executed simply typing name cou rse append file extension necessary cpl rather rich language write many utility every thing utility perform mediocre task fullfledged bbschat prog ram cpl really beyond simple scripting langage one thing prime consider adding new command cpl writing compiler subsystem tough work yes benefit would easily outweigh problem involved least viewpoint interpreted cpl quite ok though fast enough beyond scope series provide instruction programming cpl alreasy file floating around regarding file tcsb necrovore list cpl command helpful example department enough readerresponse might sit pound good cpl tutorial show  ba file executed basic source code want compile source execute compiled code enter basic sub system enter basic command line like ok basic prime basicvm called basicv available suggest use unlike standard basic basicvm virtual nature making machine memory appear hell lot larger really invoke basicvm would type command line ok basicv either way get   prompt point need load ba file compile following example assume using basicvm lot recent nature basic command similar basicvm command show following example show would look like invoke basicvm load ba program called voidbas compile quit ok basicv basicv rev  copyright c prime computer inc serial serialnumber companyname n voidbas list sample basicvm program written violence c void print basicvm example rev  revision level joke heh input line enter text print print lin end comp voidbin q ok n command stand new either n filename new filename work saying basicvm new filename voidbas basicvm lo ad voidbas workspace list command obvious comp command abbreviation compile take source code check error compiles link binary file file executed using resume command illustrated ok r voidbin basic source code well type source code cbl ftn f etc compile contains error enter available compiler must enter name language compiler available compiler consist following basic prime basic compiler basicv virtual memory basic compiler cobol cobol compiler dbasic interpreted basic doubleprecision arithmetic f compiles fortran fortran iv code ftn compiles fortran iv code ncobol nonshared nonvirtual cobol compiler plg compiles pl subset g code pma assembles prime macro assembler code rpg compiles rpg ii program nonvirtual spl compiles spl program vrpg compiles rpg ii program virtual language system commonly found prime denoted asterisk generally execute compiled source code use resume r command program located cmdnc issue filename le file extension execute use slist view source code always source code file extension denoting language type source code file extension slist lot time source file tell language coded comment header going go language many hacker familiar high level language fortran iv fortran pl subset g etc quite many one would think information presented cpl basicvm enough get way besides mean learning language looking source code file learning b purchasing language manual prime computer inc easy look file extension ftn ba plp pl pma forth remember save bin compiled code source b may seem like good easy option bad prime computer inc sell manual language piece bad consider manual cost even call prime computer inc telemarketing department request info buy right ask want manual tell freelance prime programmer love one address etc software distribution prime computer inc new york ave framingham  ext  setting editing access control list acl already learned check acl access control list protecting specified ufd also know access right mean forgotten thing please refer part ii series first explain acl set go actual editing creating acl acl stored access catagories acat protect ufd also individual file acl list user access right object cover entry acl governs right par ticular filesystem object entry acl ordered pair ill ustrated structural example identifier right two field entry acl must separated colon acls may contain pair may longer character length including blank identifier one three type single user id system group identifier like projectadministrators special identifier like rest meaning everyone else specified acl access category file contain acl acat used protect set file similar matter good example acat usage sad ufd prime computer located mfd sad protected manner file therein protected similarly basically acat useful protecting file ufd differently one another sample acl ufd called steve using acl example used section acl protecting  current directory  steve system lowery dalurw johnson dalurw rest none notice owner ufd steve right ufd obvious course also notice system right also pro bably due backup reason etc steve also given user lowery johnson dalurw access ufd possibly department working together project sort rest identifier wildcard indicating system user access steve ufd let say lowery longer work project steve johnson therefore lowery access steve ufd need terminated addition johnson need p protect access steve ufd lastly steve want add simpson acl lowery replacement perhaps perform change steve must edit ufd acl use editaccess command abbreviated edac would type ok edac user steve lowery johnson pdalurw simpson dalurw sorry runover acl related command line generally lengthy easy track modification presented examp le notice steve list system wasnt making change using edac need list acl change edac command useful editing right people acl protected ufd assuming access steve new acl look like acl protecting  current directory  steve system johnson pdalurw simpson dalurw rest none happen create account prime computer want protect ufd acl want use setaccess command abbreviated sac let go back time system administrator steve system created account also assume sys admin nt cre ate default acl steve steve create original acl entry ok sac user steve steve system lowery dalurw johnson dalurw rest none unlike edac sac requires list acl field failure list field cause field none access right edac sac usually prompt whether really want make specified change want overwrite existing acl file forth supply noquery argument end entry prompted abbreviate noquery nq good example sacing existing acl make wholesale modification avoid sure type prompt type using previous sac example ok sac user steve steve system lowery dalurw johnson dalurw rest none nq remember sacing edacing acl include full pathname acl file remember include owner right failure lock ufd filesystem object accessrelated command listaccess abbreviated la detailed part ii series rwlock setdelete protect use prime online help description command  primo abbreviation file primo command long enough inconvinience occasionally irritating type command command argument commonly use solution abbreviation primo fully support abbreviation abbreviation exactly sound like shortened command represent full command good example illustrate follows say like use detail argument ld command opposed normal form ld instead type ld det time create abbreviation called lf issued tell primo ld det b say frequently issue close command would nt nicer able type ca instead close time c say create many temporary xxxx file delete file done session instead hand deleting logout make abbreviation called dt primo interprets delete nq three example illustrate usefulness abbreviation file another nice fact abbreviation file people occasionally store password passworded ufd nonacl nua various sundry system network inspecting people abbreviation file also good hacking pract ice section describe access list use create abb reviation file abbreviation file called within cpl program well used interactive session another important fact abbreviation file contain normal command subcommands say abbreviate normal command line procedure make abb reviation enter netlink call nua log system administrator turn abbreviation file thus in tallations able use abbreviation file first let learn look use existing abbreviation file abbrev file start session must tell primo turn abb reviation file usually user logincpl logincomi file want look inside another user abbrev file need know primo command line type ok abbrev pathname pathname full pathname abbrev file wish activate see inside abbrev file issue following command ok abbrev list simple deactivate abbrev file simply type ok abbrev wish turn abbrev file back type ok abbrev activated new abbrev file abbrev pathname command use abbrev pathname file turn abbrev file note logging automatically turn active abbrev file also note one active abbrev file given time create brand new abbrev file need issue following command ok abbrev newpathname create example would ok abbrev void create ok sub net bitnet etc read  message cr next msg r  last prime file  name predatr date sun may  youth international party line kentucky empty abbrev file named void abbreviation consist two part name value name ascii character length contain character except space singlequotes comma greaterthan symbol vertical bar also remember primo con verts command line text upper case case irrelevant name note start abbreviation name hyphen enclose entire name singlequotes whenever issue abbrev command example abbreviation named void called type void forth value contain ascii text abbreviation name represents ie actual command line procedure value contain character let create sample abbrev file let fill useful abb reviations type ok abbrev add test cpl test ok abbrev add ca close ok abbrev add lf ld det ok abbrev list abbreviation file user tvh void abbreviation test cpl test ca close lf ld det ok okay created three abbreviation abbreviation interpreted command primo command line thus typing ok test execute cpl program called test testcpl recall cpl require enter file extension ca would act like typed close aware abbreviation file contain abbreviation delete abbreviation file entry type ok abbrev delete abbrevname thus delete test abbreviation would type ok abbrev delete test basic abbreviation subsystem advanced command gone due spacial limitation obtain information abbreviation subsystem type ok abbrev help  physical system console physical system console prime computer added power local remote terminal one specific console several potent operator command issued invoked successfully consolespecific command boring hacker system programming prime command however rather useful useful console command resus enable command might recall part iii resus remote system user facility say resus enabled logged administrator account actually virtual system console allow console command able used local remote terminal enable argument simply tell primo want turn resus another useful console command user logoff command able logoff user advised useful command log management command allow make presence system virtually unknown simply edit log primo network related kill reference much full list operator command invoke online help facility typing guessed help without argument list primo command pick say operator command beside really going continue topic hard time getting console capability unless onsite fool resus enabled using sys prived account nt need logging command edit log sys privs lastly way getting console discus want know additional method available work

revision xx xx earlier actually tell whether given user id valid asking password make rather trivial task determining whether given account exists experience early revision primo found obscure net like brazil japan archaic revision primo enter ctrlc password valid account automatically bypass front door password security nice barely find ancient revision anymore older revision like current revision primo suggest reading hacking primo article nanuk north plan penetrating revision file written day xx common really much say probably never come across revision even command structure use
