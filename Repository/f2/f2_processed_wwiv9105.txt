actually called system uploaded art gratitude sincere appreciate go people participated  cover  contest great entry tough choice everybody including people lizard lick nc know net release software dawn new age age network compression first brought somewhat netzip netzip ii wwivpack wayne made obsolete us pkzip technology directly software eliminating need sort program would compress packet detail see net release note included elsewhere issue another issue note john hardman group gc stepping may gc leaving wwivnet bbsing altogether june wwivnet truly sorry leaf many sysops miss also brings interesting topic next one appointed far know john first gc replaced wayne appoint one john oversee election within group john wayne simply appoint new gc new step wwivnet history interesting see turn another interesting issue area code node shy full mean need new node number go wayne say digit node number obvious solution since possible range node number run main topic issue brings mind sysops sub type since traditional numbering system consists adding node number sub type conflict probably arise please send suggestion comment etc wwivnews co  acknowledgement wwiv c wayne bell
