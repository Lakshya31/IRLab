otherwise informed computer modem user root problem fact term  baud   bit per second  used interchangeably indiscriminately strongly suspect result fact easier say  baud   bit per second  though misinformation hand ever found confused relationship bit baud rate think modem baud rate number bit character transmits per second please read article carefully guarantee clear confusion disabuse false concept  bit per second bps bit per second measure number data bit digital transmitted second communication channel sometimes referred  bit rate  individual character letter number etc also referred byte composed several bit modem bit rate tied baud rate two explained baud rate baud rate measure number time per second signal communication channel varies make transition state state frequency voltage level phase angle one baud one change thus baud modem signal change state time second  baud modem signal change state time per second necessarily mean baud baud modem transmit bit per second learn line determining bit per second depending modulation technique used modem transmit one bit  le one bit  baud change state put another way one change state transmit one bit  le one bit mentioned earlier number bit modem transmits per second directly related number baud occur second number necessarily illustrate first consider modem baud rate using transmission technique called fsk frequency shift keying four different frequency turned represent digital signal modem fsk used baud gain change state transmits one bit one change state required send bit thus modem bps rate also baud per second x bit per baud bps similarly modem operating baud use one change state send bit modem bps rate would baud modem way remember demonstrative hypothetical example consider hypothetical baud modem using modulation technique requires two change state send one bit also viewed  bit per baud modem bps rate would bps baud per second x  baud per bit bps look another way bit per second also obtained dividing modem baud rate number change state baud required send one bit baud        bps baud per bit let move away hypothetical reality exists world modulation first lest misled thinking  baud modem  able operate bps twobitsper baud modulation technique remember said baud modem medium highspeed modem use baud rate lower bps rate along however use multiplestate modulation send one bit per baud example bps modem conform bell standard includes bps modem used u operate baud use modulation technique called phase modulation transmits four bit per baud modem capable bps operation bps baud modem use baud rate baud x bit per baud bps baud          bps  baud per bit similarly bps modem conform ccitt v recommendation virtually actually use baud rate operate bps however also use modulation technique transmits four bit per baud baud x bit per baud bps baud          bps  baud per bit thus bps modem baud modem bps modem baud modem let take look bps modem operate baud use modulation technique yield four bit per baud thus baud x bit per baud bps baud          bps  baud per bit character per second cps character per second number character letter number space symbol transmitted communication channel one second cps often bottom line rating data transmission speed convenient way thinking data transfer baud bitrate determining number character transmitted per second easy simply divide bps rate number bit per character must course take account fact bit make binary digit representing character transmitted character sent one system another fact bit may transmitted character ascii transfer whether data bit used called start stopbits added character sending system enable receiving system determine group bit make character addition system usually add parity bit bit ascii transmission computer serial port handle addition extra bit extra bit stripped receiving end asynchronous data communication number bit per character usually either data bit plus parity bit plus start bit stop bit data bit plus start bit stop bit thus bps            character per second bit per character bps            character per second bit per character bps            character per second bit per character common speed commonlyused communication rate dialup system bbs online service like compuserve delphi genie bps older system  especially telex system  communicate bps gradually going way dinosaur bps modem generally available online service bbs accommodate changing near future however cost highspeed modem technology decreasing demand increase modem even higher bps rate manufactured  used dialup system upper limit asynchronous data transmission via voicegrade telephone line appears bps use higher transmission rate requires special dedicated line  conditioned  ie
