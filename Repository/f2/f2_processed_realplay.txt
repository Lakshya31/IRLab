game design address steve jackson presented  joks tecnojocs  conference barcelona spain june copyright steve jackson right reserved  realism v playability  argument probably oldest question simulation gaming game stress one expense important mutually exclusive defining term must start defining two term made complex fact game designer mean one thing talk  realism   playability  player may mean something entirely different first shall look question viewpoint game designer designer say game  realistic  first real game people simulate battle actually shooting nonlethal weapon example include survival game played gun fire paint ball photon us sophisticated optical technology killer player use waterguns dart gun similar toy military sophisticated  war game  use real tank gun substitute laser sight explosive fit category second game designer might call game  realistic  present provably accurate analog reality example infantry march mile day good road game depicts  realistic  use term  reality check  indicate process testing game becomes hard realitycheck aspect game conveniently quantified physical injury game might say man take  ten hit  damage point real injury say  five hit damage man take another five hit dy  third designer might call game  realistic  feel give overall effect reality even though subsystem may realistic example game axis ally originally created nova published mass market milton bradley game hugely successful give good  feel  overall impression strategic truth world war ii even though movement combat highly abstract sense realistic finally game designer might call game  realistic  give overall effect match appropriate sort fiction saying true source sense game toon realistic respect cartoon dungeon dragon realistic respect thudandblunder fantasy fiction like genre consider game realistic playability game designer say game  playable  one three circumstance first game may termed  playable  learned quickly correctly obviously simpler rule easier learn even important rule wellexplained insofar possible intuitive nature might accurate use term  learnable   learnerfriendly  type playability designer including  jumpstart rule  simple beginner version boardgames computer game second game may accurately called  playable  played quickly easily learned minimum reference rule rather complex game playable sense rule make much sense learn know classic monopoly good example people learn monopoly written rule instead monopoly passed oral tradition parent child older brother younger one one game fit pattern embarrassing way never succeeded writing rule illuminati way make easy read new player sitting group learn game quickly wish could capture put box many game like learned oral tradition passed almost like folklore true meaning word  playable  finally game designer may call game  playable  technical sense various subsystem mesh together smoothly component  friendly  easy use often see opposite term  hostile  design game complex piece easy knock blown away wind example hostile component oftused chart separated buried rule hostile rulebook design must consider definition used player one game meant player call game realistic usually mean one two thing  read rule looked really complicated  player nt know whether game actually realistic impressed intimidated thick rulebooks lot chart note great fallacy many realistic game complex complex game realistic complexity almost never desirable thing player may mean  realistic   playing nothing seemed really stupid  carry complicated test reality game presented nothing insulted intelligence returning example infantry could march mile day along good road player may know much history may never army read think  sound right  game said mile mile might still accept rule said  infantry march mile per day along good road  player would seize foolish would tend lose faith representation made game important note player judge realism experience expectation player sophisticated experienced may strange idea  reality  sincerely held instance gaming convention overheard young player saying  game nt realistic character hit two arrow almost died  may seem ridiculous thing say consider source player clearly personal experience battle seen western movie hero shot time st stephen keep fighting playing fantasy game would call  unrealistic  hero jump tall building hit repeatedly battleax take trivial harm player honestly believed human body indestructible critical game nt reflect belief playability player call game playable mean  fun   fun   playable  mean player let take example game professional would call  unplayable  original edition dungeon dragon poorly written badly organized almost crossreferences contradiction omission nevertheless lot people dungeon dragon playable thought understand rule fun second second meaning player important point  playable  really mean fun nothing fun player mind enjoy game call playable see  realism   playability  highly subjective term may mean different thing different people important professional creator critic game understand technical meaning applied term order create effective simulation game purpose rather lucky accident necessary know different simpler interpretation average player put term setting balance clear whatever mean  realism  whatever mean  playability  important desirable ca nt much either however generally accepted tradeoff required game extremely realistic playability suffer game playable loss realism empirically often true although absolute law say realism playability must conflict designer usually find choosing two point effective presentation particular balance chosen depends largely game desired audience realism important older hobbyist market customer tend toward scholarly attitude playability important younger player mass market dealing shorter attention span often lower educational level wrong say le demanding audience may require scholarship insist entertained indeed want entertained right chosen desired balance achieve number choice make balancing realism playability classic one include chart table specific effect v  generic  effect game may ignore weather may two kind weather clear cloudy may complex table dozen different kind weather modifier applied depending season hit location effect result damage whether individual ship tank whole military organization may simple  dead alive  may complex degree injury various method repair recovery military simulation may complex supply rule game may take supply granted assuming one ever run ammunition likewise military simulation unit map may  zone control  affecting travel hostile unit adjacent map area rule simplified omitted entirely quite complex developed form zone control rule require detailed consultation rulebook every time unit move near enemy see whether allowed proceed even turn sequence may simple complex simple game one player take turn one take turn military game tank could move one protected point another crossing open space ending turn safe place complex game may layer partial conditional response within turn game tank moving opponent might say  hold going fire open  achieving realism classic way achieve realism research easy check weight sword composition battalion fact harder check harder sure right le really matter guess good guess right good question game mechanic must also echo reality real life certain cause produce certain effect game mechanic copy closely possible also important playtest unexpected synergy two individually reasonable rule produce silly result interact finally nt shoot high try simulate lose fail first game ever created ogre often seen realistic limited try portray nobody expects much simple system simple system go produce goodseeming result achieving playability first make game playable make friendly rule component attractive easy read easy use second make easy attractive learn game gauged audience simple hobby game hard rank beginner learn simple beginner game would scorned hobbyist nt worry know market start nt worry someone outside market criticizes nt meant finally use logic mnemonic help make easy learn easy remember easy play also seen aiding realism whether actually make game  real  example roleplaying game often necessary determine whether character successfully used skill rolling directly skill simpler better looking skill number chart rolling arbitrary odds number conclusion conclude realism playability important playability game insufficiently realistic still fun marketplace  unrealistic  often slap wrist dungeon dragon terribly unrealistic tsr cry way bank realistic system languish bestseller cosmic encounter illuminati make attempt whatsoever portray real life insufficient playability usually fatal right start  unplayable  nastiest word reviewer even worse  overpriced  example would offer spi campaign north africa admired research probably never played among roleplaying game fgu chivalry sorcery chock full good idea bad rule copy probably used sourcebooks designer make game playable make realistic without sacrificing playability may surprised much realism still achieve keep trying game better
