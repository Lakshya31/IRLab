procedure book magic mushroom cultivation steven h pollock md  simplest technique scratch simplest cultivation technique growing magic mushroom spore requires little way supply needed manure vermiculite water canning jar pressure cooker course spore technique work well san isidro psilocybe cubensis mushroom grow dung nature especially panaeolus specie selection manure important slightly aged manure used manure fresh messy work old le suitable growth medium porous texture horse manure preferable cattle manure manure herbivorous mammal sheep even elephant used growing mushroom composted manure excellent manure gathered directly stall stable breaking year however sometimes unsuitable method use commercially packaged manure either commercial processing usually like dirt real manure sometimes farm sell cow manure largely separated dirt machine placed huge pile begin compost ideal manure selected next step pour vermiculite   cup wide mouth canning jar add manure overdo add enough cover vermiculite layer  inch manure amount critical instance necessary cover vermiculite purpose vermiculite hold moisture keep manure burning bottom jar steam sterilized pressure cooker manure layer need uniform thickness fact best use relatively small broken piece manure irregular shape order provide plenty surface area growing mycelium besides relatively large intact piece manure tend resistant complete sterilization pressure cooker manure layer place squirt well water spray bottle desirable start plenty water produce environment adequate moisture spore germinate pressure cooking tends dry manure unless sufficient water water easily seen accumulating bottom jar vermiculite layer spraying add  cup water le deemed necessary much water however cause manure undergo dissolution muddy consistency sterilization desirable advantage uncomposted horse manure rather resistant dissolution sterilization take much effort get knack much water use prepare many jar desired better glass container erlenmeyer flask may used lieu canning jar method starting spore canning jar convenient practical enough water added place dome canning jar lid upside mouth jar rubber seal face screw band lid leave loose object allow pressure inside jar equilibrate pressure cooker flask glass container used cotton plug employed aluminum foil outer wrapping quart pressure cooker hold quart canning jar large pressure cooker room two layer quart jar allows greater production place jar bottom rack pressure cooker add water usually three quart water sufficient quart cooker one way sure

started one large spore print entire inoculating procedure important work draftfree area therefore keep door window closed run heating air conditioning least several hour making spore inoculation also important control breathing inoculating jar since breathing open jar may contaminate really necessary case wear mask may make difference enthusiast anywhere three day couple week depending age spore print white mycelium would noticeable jar multiple site manure san isidro mycelium fluffy mycelium panaeolus contaminant start grow usually color often green since manure natural substrate mushroom specie grown ordinarily growth mushroom mycelium rather contaminant favored san isidro mycelium frequently complete growth commence form mushroom within month may take six week rarely longer panaeolus specie slower make mushroom small container furthermore mushroom grown small container quart jar tend much smaller grown larger container compost outdoors therefore magic mushroom grower might reasonably wish use mycelium quart jar  spawn  larger container compost bed advisable refrain using spawn large scale cultivation project observed make mushroom  myceliumtxt jul
