mistimed kick jumped opponent word land wrong side kick time covered anyway try kidding wall bounce jump diagonally hit edge screen air actually hit edge pull stick diagonally opposite direction initial jump hit edge instead falling straight start new jump opposite direction even standing right next walledge screen important move longest leap make giving great range attack near edge screen use get trouble get cornered vega also move watch ok got move practice level comfortable let look stagescharacters following loosely organized easiest hardest based level play computer vary technique level much easier bonus stage brick pile destruction car weapon choice roundhouse lightning leg button held screen first appears even get  start  way soon round start launch lightning leg destroys first section see chun li start kicking let go key continue lightning kick nt worry wait finish kick brick diagonal forward jump air hit hold roundhouse lightning kick get one quick hit air land top first level top pile start pounding away stand holding key nt waste time get second brick car first section blown away jump top car run across fall ground side walk close hold roundhouse lightning leg able finish round second spare chun li v zangief zangief pushover believe completely eradicate sucker one move straight roundhouse round start wait zangief walk towards always take offensive jump straight air jump response immediately hit roundhouse key nail air range better nt jump wait downward part jump hit roundhouse key normally kick face move practice timing downward movement trust play entire round perfect score one move timing tricky upward kick coming though land repeat process might wait walk towards little bit range kick thing zangief block roundhouse happens either jump straight immediately repeat roundhouse eventually miss block land pull hit roundhouse kick sideways leg balanced hand usually happens fast move previous block new position hit go back straight jump roundhouse air human zangief still tear guy apart even really good human player control zangief keep mind straight roundhouse kick better range spinning clothesline find human opponent rely lot fear mistiming straight roundhouse nt get kick land foot directly front bad news never tangle zangief close range even going use tactic tick player might insist use make agreement use straight roundhouse use jumping ability jump hit jump back bounce wall keep cornered chun li v ryu yeah right computer opponent consider ryu totally worthless let give template beat level ryu every time round even begin stick pointed towards ryu walking towards round start take one two step press  l  shoulder throw computer ryu start  round walking towards subsequently fall throw every time b shoulder throw precharge lightning leg towards ryu jump diagonally towards hold roundhouse button jump land promptly start pounding soon stand throw even block hurting kick hit move slowly farther away let go kick key first two hit wait lightning leg expire c followed ryu far right wall right two choice repeat step b loose chance perfect round land lightning kick revved ryu strong punch hit although hit choice jump towards immediately pull hold repeating kick key head stomp  time bounce wall backwards generalization hit repeat attack lighting leg time first thing character distance weapon ken ryu dhalsim guile fire weapon scenario would happen b c ryu throwing fireball leaping air preparing head stomp tactic work well character especially dhalsim key successful lightning leg jump towards opponent avoid subsequent distance attack offensive move prepared followed scenario head stomp step c ryu probably heavily damaged little way left bouncing wall almost certainly fire fireball jump straight air watch go repeat necessary eventually tire come walking towards happens repeat step kill first throw human ryu human player worth damn going fall opening shoulder throw twice vary opening attack scenario start round moving away ryu fireball try jump straight nt worry ca nt let block happen look section response typical ryuken attack response hurricane kick ken ryu go hurricane kick close body width go block right away let hit couple time settling ground push forward hit  l  shoulder throw note computer opponent follow hurricane kick dragon punch keep block dragon punch catch way punch throw throw always go offensive precharge lightning leg kick throw step away kenryu start hurricane kick wait body width away hit  l  fierce punch kind funny actually chun li hand configuration end delicate location ken ryu defense committed hurricane try best range achieved push stick towards opponent right hit  l  response dragon punch see block backwards stay area wait start come push forward  l  throw go offensive computer kenryus almost always one dragon punch row take long time recover dragon punch le three body width away dragon punch time walk wait start coming shoulder throw response fireball simple either jump straight preferred block dangerous one slow fireball crafty human opponent try lure jumping straight slow fireball walk towards air happens try roundhouse right touch get every time make timing le crucial stay away human ken ryu screen remember back cornered using bounce wall trick response jumping ryuken favorite trick computer ryuken jump around lot human player computer player jumping back forth ignore eventually fire fireball instead jumping start jumping towards human player watch distance jump place position think land next jump halfway jump standing roundhouse hit  r  key standing roundhouse longer range flying roundhouse ken ryu probably attempting hit coming bounce backwards special note dangerous try jump diagonally away ken ryu fireball travel speed jump may come right middle one jump straight needed diagonal jump requires precise timing nt tackle comfortable beating guy chun li v ken first read section especially response attack keep mind ken ryu character difference playing two level snes opening ryu always start moving towards making easy throw best opening move ken defensive start backing away likely launch hurricane kick let come keep block pulling away follow hurricane dragon punch let happen start come push forward hit  l  throw performed step ryu text follow template right ken fond hurricane kick ryu also jump read  response xxx  section ryu response either ken ryu want gamble computer open round fierce punch ken hurricane kick nail time otherwise jumping away effect chance throw fireball case nailed chun li v dhalsim template dhalsim close ryuken except opening go first move round diagonal jump towards dhalsim started dhalsim one several thing yoga fire jump straight stretch attack way slice attack choice hit   button start jump hold either hit air jump straight hit come case launch lightning leg throw backwards b throw backwards attack basically repeat move jump diagonally towards come lightning leg revved use roundhouse want dhalsim nt seem able counter others c step b dhalsim wall right one usually safe keep performing step b chance counter perfect round diagonal jump towards quickly come lightning leg head stomp bounce wall go defensive round wait come usually prefer finishing beginning though chun li v e honda honda really hard got special consideration compared player basic template honda flying leap towards rev lightning kick come like would character character attack le effective honda backed wall jump head stomp jump away keep following mind always use regular lightning leg honda   key timing counter others b honda block air cross hand front face immediately let go lightning leg key pull stick diagonally backwards land still short lightning leg attack previous revving kick finish honda jump towards followed instruction timing perfect jump right underneath keep stick held diagonally backwards want jump away get maneuvering room c honda hundred hand slap outside range hand jump lightning leg safe attack properly executed wo nt get hit two far away jump land range hand rather body hand hit unless sure honda stunned attempt shoulder throw unbelievably fast bear hug get caught bear hug start pounding button swirling joystick around basically spaz break faster e torpedo head butt jump straight come head stomp nail every time f never stand close honda start hand slap pound jump lightning leg revved jump basic sequence beat time nothing else human player honda usually much easier beat computer keep mind much faster jumping head stomp great airborne roundhouse good range stuff work fine human opponent chun li v guile guile trick sleeve countered basic template first move round straight jump guile either start walking towards sonic boom walk backwards time walk towards crouch step away may look like range air roundhouse kick crouched wait almost touching ground hit  r  kick head sending flying backwards b immediately jump diagonally towards rev lightning leg air come use roundhouse lightning leg guile come start pounding  release leg wait expire c like dhalsim guile always follow lightning leg attack sonic boom counter best thing jump straight dangerous jump towards guile sonic bomb unlike dhalsimkenryu fireball reason immediate flash kick nail general guideline ca nt finish opening template move open wall wait guile approach jump straight kneel start avoid boom jumping straight sometimes guile weird little sequence follows chun li jump straight stand outside range roundhouse let loose land pause second throw fierce punch trick hesitate second landing jump straight roundhouse sequence little tricky luckily wo nt get damaged much even connects fierce jump diagonally guile unless kicked head thrown back computer instantly unleash flash kick nail hard nothing practical flash kick except avoid like dragon punch take little time recover using use opportunity throw human guile guile match well chun li good guile player give hard time keep mind airborne roundhouse kick greater range straight air roundhouse timed extend farther punch counter flash kick leaping away close far away flash kick try leap towards catch coming air shoulder throw push towards hit  l  lot damage guile sweep better range nt go toe toe instead leap straight approach roundhouse chun li v blanka blanka problem fast strong offensive move computer play pretty well still possible master move beat consistently basic precharge lightning kick still important move fact open round hear  fight  jump diagonally towards blanka come lightning leg firing usually use normal also use roundhouse possible blanka jump towards first move go able hit kick jump towards react quickly switch air shoulder throw otherwise hit assuming got initial lightning leg jump pound another jump head stomp point bounce wall head stomped away important usual stay clear blanka good range close attack anything chun li except fierce punchlunge preceding sequence pretty damaged unlike character blanka erratic action point start jumping towards jump away wait next jump time jump towards hit coming reasonably safe move otherwise move attempt precharge lightning leg thing look start jumping straight blanka thinking rolling attack chun li head stomp work rolling attack hard time rolling attack much faster character move safest jump straight avoid block remember punch kick blanka rolling attack normal damage see suddenly crouch far away definitely unleash rolling attack b blanka hard stun nt stay way long manage nt trust stun mean careful attempt shoulder throw c blanka character recommend stay away straight roundhouse got many attack counter never ever try whirlwind kick blanka nt use whirlwind anyway blanka invariably time rolling attack right try whirlwind pound chun li v balrog balrog massive damage opponent moron basically treat balrog zangief susceptible straight roundhouse typical sequence start round jumping straight balrog may rush walk trying punch either way range come straight jump release airborne roundhouse hit head fly backwards c hitting balrog roundhouse time safe flying jump lightning leg use roundhouse lightning leg probably crouch block immediately coming lightning leg balrog jump diagonally towards jump straight roundhouse hit come beat balrog entirely standing one place straight roundhouse like zangief key jump farther away used probably rush last step nt want ground happens even walking make range barely take little practice get jump point right obvious nt get backed corner balrog end boss let get wall may never even chance jump dead chun li v vega vega requires precise timing character counter learn timing beat consistently easy get frustrated think impossible beat first stay general guideline leaping away vega lot always combine backwards leap standard kick general guideline staying ground something wrong start jumping way beat vega vega start every round least level leap away stand start walking towards leap note vega pain play move set far jump etc basically tricky part vega coming towards want wait close enough would hit forward leapregular kick combo however time try leap away quickly enough wo nt hit usually leap backwards first attempt unsuccessful vega probably leap forward directly land want going backwards wait another opportunity try c hit vega leap lightning leg fact never lightning leg one kick instead leap towards second time try another flying standard kick hit fall backwards try lightning leg aware simply learn use lightning leg vega might want stick leaping back forth first little weird something try ca nt get timing right step jumping back forth get hit vega behavior change either hit hit start bouncing edge screen happened like chun li weak point vega jump backwards towards edge screen jump hit rather wait hit edge start bounce back towards wait bounce back towards started able jump diagonally towards hit standard kick hit come e vega start climbing cage walk whichever side maneuvering room stop  body width away side wait prepared diagonal jump away wherever vega wall soon jump wall jump diagonally away simultaneously hitting standard kick hit come often several wallclimb attack row prepared another f get vega lightning leg safest assume jump diagonally away soon completed let go kick button immediately starting lightning leg pull diagonally back stick finish kick jump away vega variety nasty counter come lightning leg chun li v bison first thing know computer basically cheat like hell playing bison nt get frustrated bison character left despite solid understanding beat still kill fair consistency hand gone double perfect round innumerable time invincible bison unpredictable given move ever round first one jump straight air one  jump halfway across screen  leap hit roundhouse otherwise wait coming walking towards last second roundhouse land hit head rest move basically reaction various thing bison attempt flaming torpedo jump straight come head stomp unfortunately computer bring bison almost torpedo already blocking probably block beat getting hit though better success actually hitting stomp try time hit start coming underneath rather middle body b stay middle screen get close wall toast allow bison beginning strong combination attack basically c air friend lot jumping bison also susceptible straight roundhouse kick aware block good number keep jumping straight roundhousing hope catch block one thing work advantage try power punch sooner later see hand turn electric air roundhouse hit anticipate soon hit kick leaping towards another roundhouse also hit decide whether get another kick lightning leg possible jump away middle screen beat flying kick bison jumping straight roundhousing usual better range stuff e catch bison lightning leg let fly let go kick button probably block successfully usual knocked backwards block end little way away come leg almost always response leap towards flying kick response jump straight roundhouse special case recovering lightning leg wait half second jump straight otherwise miss kick hit well folk writing character later may revise document well send suggestion comment email address fun playing new player game nt expect come guarantee strategy work may need get comfortable controlling chun li first also nt expect walk arcade champion
