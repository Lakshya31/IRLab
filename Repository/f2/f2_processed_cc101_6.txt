part network access network        credit card application cost access network single biggest factor overall cost often accounting half total reason many different solu tions depending provider application geographical constraint simplest form access network us service one many form terminal merchant location across country dial number terminated large hunt group modem con nected directly acquirer frontend processor fep fep typically faulttolerant machine since outage take entire service large acquirer typically two center terminating service allows better economy due nature service tariff allows di saster recovery case failure one data center advantage service quite easy cover entire country also provides effective utilization fep resource little queuing theory show however service quite expensive always requires digit di aled area pulse dialing take almost three second dial  delay dialing connection longer call many call way call get routed add perceived response time mer chant location even though acquirer control large acquirer prefer offer form local access service service terminal merchant dial local telephone number gain access acquirer typically local number actually connects packet network connects acquirer packet network public network terminal must go login sequence get connected across packet network typically local call much le expensive service call local call typically connect faster call cost call absorbed merchant directly remaining area local call still free business line work well merchant otherwise merchant end spending lot money phone call usually acquirer offer lower price accepters use local call help offset even network generally much le expensive acquirer network difficult maintain due distributed nature access network since packet network much likely experience failure phone network merchant po terminal usually programmed dial number fallback local number nt work also generally costeffec tive cover every free calling area entire country access equipment service required anyway also administrative headache associated keeping track different phone number merchant across country need dial ten thousand terminal support

original tent made difficult implement far big switched access capability likely im pact future isdn far inhibited limited availability lack adequate equipment merchant end could beneficial problem solved privateline network pretty straightforward application pointtopoint multipoint private line since private line quite expensive engineering network challenging usually sophisticated software used determine optimum placement concentrators order minimize cost since tariff real estate price business need change frequently maintaining stable costeffective network hard work typical asynchronous private line network multiplexer remote site backbone link companion multiplexer central site synchronous private line network may use multiplexer remote controller remote feps depending
