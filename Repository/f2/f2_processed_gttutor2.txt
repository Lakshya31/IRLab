 following second conversational chat james davis raymond wood designed followup first one take form tutorial due high number request following first one released note update original text discovered inadvertant error original confused sealink zmodem relative implementation network flow control  shall start kind outline think go discussed many fundamental involved communication first tutorial ended discussing several popular file transfer protocol session go farther area file transfer protocol technology bit per second modem error correcting modem mnp arq one go intelligently selecting protocol given basic understanding environment example ymodem described king hill come performance true using one packet switching network also true bit per second w mentioned mnp thought industry standard practical end talking language hardware also mnp implemented hardware modem  wrong wrong gt powercomm  support baud believe newest version qmodem  well paul meiners author gt powercomm usrobotics hst baud modem using every day usr hst well microcom mnp modem testing two quite different error correction method use time mnp microcom networking protocol developed microcom arq general term used usr mean automatic retry request protocol specifically called usrhst high speed technology two method totally incompatible even method used modulate baud signal appears incompatible however successfully connected two different brand modem reliability mode usr ability fallback mnp baud mnp established standard course make sense pcp user also connected usr hst modem seen outstanding performance baud cruised along cps transfer million byte far gt efficient comm program able drive modem  bit per second system modem communicating another modem additional performance reason implement flow control transmitting modem overrun discus detail little later tutorial correct standard baud mean baud modem necessarily impractical determining extent problem concern different modulation method nevertheless stop support baud finally right mnp arq hardware function transparent one note example since began testing modem connected several many others result totally eliminated line noise present prior mnp connection ie appears mnp error free file transfer thus must look test various nonerror checking protocol used environment ymodemg example much learning curve u user must behind scene credibility sake w understand necessity stay technological advance affecting product clear exactly mnp arq come shed light since baud modem really baud bit per second baud modem clear limit reliable communication term speed using bandwidth existing telephone circuitry reached however also clear densely pack information within bandwidth incidence error increase manufacturer investigated starting microcom various error detection recovery method hardware assisted birth mnp microcom networking protocol evolution technology result several level mnp available today higher level function included level mnp merely insures data received modem sent sending modem insufficient opinion valid scenario one receiving computer insured received accurately sending computer sent cable port circuit timing etc mnp check thus seems combination software hardware error detection correction method necessary almost file transfer protocol check believe necessary computer computer accuracy advantage mnp well begin efficient software need concerned data byte crc control byte faster newer level mnp efficient might guessed strip start bit stop bit byte example increase transfer performance bit per byte rather send compressed data via internal algorithm increase performance even side ledger mnp arq technology built disadvantage performance point view longer high speed pipe full computer usually z prone modest slowdown higher speed nevertheless baud possible obtain cps rather baud possible obtain upwards cps rather forget mentioned earlier mnp active time protocol transfer active transfer thus line noise effectively filtered even chatting several possible advantage disadvantage least lack standard w jim understand said would seem mnp needed end job correct also mnp proprietary microcom modem obviously true mnp arq must exist end functional microcom modem connects nonmnp modem recognizes fact reverts standard hayes compatible modem usr hst connects microcom mnp fallback baud rate baud modem communicate using mnp likely overridden user however via disabling mnp arq situation opinion however reasonably certain baud connection established without error correction functional microcom mnp wider used arq usr method usr method supporting different baud rate flexible argues usr may obtained wrong baud modem time part testing learning process proprietary nature mnp according usrobotics microcom placed least first three level mnp public domain certain generous licensing least lower level manufacturer alternative unless standard evolves contest damage future advance w seems obvious standard area advantage concerned standard organization looking would like baud capability error free transmission however would also like communicate whomever without worry whats end see concerned course paraphrase earlier discussion think standard organization effective called marketplace huge power hayes organization modem standard likely telling blow manufacturer finally put baud technology may well become new standard believe premature buy long security issue usrobotics microcom w whenever talk hayes people convention trade show know say nothing development know policy think introduce would necessarily mean whatever standard may naive would like believe case say others active meeting need appear argument point remains valid hayes something near term intel saw happens get confident let competition pas first put microcomputer chip marketplace made save z took away awfully long time able come back motorola nearly hayes far largest visible shelf space industry moment usr guess microcom could steal away lack responsive attention part w would seem need compatible hardware baud compatible software well truly effective increased performance paul meiners megalink protocol tie somehow megalink extremely efficient protocol particularly designed network environment like pcp higher baud rate network friendly mean recognizes honor flow control imposed network efficiency us byte packet block full streaming protocol mean ever stop sending unless receives nak saying packet received error batch oriented us block header information  link protocol resulting file size properly time date stamped us bit crc rather rather think time go back earlier tutorial add concept time since last discussion increased popularity two relatively new file protocol first called sealink second zmodem recall earlier discussion windowing technique beginning become available file transfer protocol windowing kermit example well wxmodem program attempt obtain better performance avoiding startstop approach used earlier protocol sending packet data transmitter would stop wait acknowledgment packet properly received sending next one windowing protocol assume packet received without error wait packet receiving system send ack signal transmitter waiting assuming well time saved result error occur nak returned transmitter associated signal packet number error assuming transmitter still packet disposal merely retransmits proceeds limit course order able retransmit packet must still transmit buffer buffer finite length windowing protocol set maximum window size mean x packet sent without reply transmitter forced wait reply else error recovery would work big deal baud really quite limiting sealink windowing protocol added advantage wxmodem example two important feature us byte crc increased reliability us window size rather used wxmodem networkfriendly networkfriendly design recognizes honor xonxoff signal placed packet switching network network like pc pursuit becomes busy nearly choking data network place xoff line networkfriendly recognizes rather coincidental configuration bit byte data stop sending data stop receives xon network important well experience huge number subscriber exists pcp forcing network exceed ability handle data could crash network pcp would allow intelligent node controller selectively abort hog link honor earlier request wait little via xoff thus using protocol networkfriendly like saying  nt care hog nt like abort  usage continues increase network oblige attitude result networkfriendly two fold term hit performance waiting network send xon sending data many extra byte control information definitionally must sent along data let explain last point obvious know xoff xon simply byte like letter digit data file contained byte would easy implement networkfriendly protocol recall however almost always true data sent form archive compressed format resulting byte configuration despite unarchived un compressed file look like word odds essentially data file send consist probably many byte look like xoff xon allowed happen protocol find byte encapsulates called escape sequence consists special byte usually dle character followed folded duplicate byte needed camouflaged xon xoff folding merely mean byte transmogrified way usually via sent compliment xored dle character must also escape sequenced method work random process result indeterminate performance particular file file none three special byte combination time transmit would minimal file happened many many byte send order escape sequence case file would take longer transmit first protocol different performance balance designer sealink excellent job performance sealink essentially good wxmodem yet reliable us link header sealink becoming popular protocol supported bb system called opus quickly replacing old fido system country good protocolbecause networkfriendly bother nt escape coding anything probably fatal mistake future particularly network get crowded next one interest called zmodem almost always found external protocol mean included file dszexe shelled host terminal communication program needed requires lot memory compared internal protocol easy install protocol offering many bb system another significant difference zmodem protocol already discussed far instead startstop nature instead windowing streaming protocol streaming protocol expect get ack signal back receiver transfer complete successful error occurs receive nak transmitter insure recover nak received thus windowed protocol never stop transmitting unless error mean faster even windowing protocol zmodem us bit crc reliability networkfriendly way userfriendly however example every protocol way terminate transfer wish progress usual manner press cntlx one two time wait till end recognizes abort request finally stop case zmodem must time row stop suggest user thousand know popular protocol result performance packet switching network incidentally also escape sequenced fourth byte syn rather obscure reason believe mistake included gt powercomm  newest file transfer protocol called megalink us bit crc networkfriendly faster sealink like link named protocol us header record result exact size proper time date stamping resulting file received interesting megalink well performs highest baud rate running comparative test four different protocol sending k file machine baud obtained following result wxmodem  efficiency cps sealink  cps ymodem  cps zmodem unsuccessful megalink  cps order wxmodem poorly two reason baud window limit windowing technique second ack signal coming back packet sent baud arena transmission baud one direction baud transparent le user modem automatically change direction baud based volume data need sent direction one time one character ack baud significant acknak response actually either two three byte rather one might expect additional byte packet number compliment sealink driven fast go fast ymodem small window us like wxmodem many character transmit networkfriendly escape sequence ymodem going fast effected primarily startstop nature function fact acknaks coming back baud see clearly indication day startstop protocol numbered aside ymodemg would performed much better error control whatever thus fewer byte transmit turnaround delay remember however error correcting modem capable insuring data sent one modem received reliably seen discussion later zmodem total failure ymodemg would reliably worked test interesting zmodem failed altogether baud reason little subtle lead next thing wanted discus anyway earlier mentioned mnp arq modem able strip start stop bit byte must thus synchronous mode rather asynchronous also may use form compression beyond performance reason stated baud modem using able perform cps rather may caused ponder modem connect computer baud mean computer send character per second modem subsequent transmission modem send faster receives answer method use obtain extraordinary performance connect computer modem  baud utilize buffer modem match input output naturally data arriving modem much faster leaving must way stop input well guessed use flow control like network getting choked particular sense modem clear send signal stop sending data instantly start cramming data  baud way modem able send data cps naturally modem must able control ct signal work usrobotics hst capable showed happened zmodem tried transfer excess baud failed entirely fault zmodem however unless receiving system class computer probably find regardless kind software using modem faster computer ability feed eat amazing nt modem paced computer attached instead way around incidentally unless receiving computer connect receiving modem  instead baud implemented form flow control
