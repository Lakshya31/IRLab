ccittproposed standard  kbps previously referred vfast courier vbis courier hst dual standard shared access modem sharing kit product currently included program field upgrade available soon ccitt  kbps draft recommendation completed official approval standard expected january  ccittproposed  kbps standard wo nt reality manufacturer  said jonathan zakin u robotics executive vice president sale marketing  offering modem ready  kbps providing insurance technical obsolescence customer purchase courier highspeed modem shared access modem sharing kit take advantage updated technology available  kbps standard becomes available later already costeffective upgrade option wo nt reinvest new equipment   key  kbps program fact upgrade courier highspeed modem shared access modem sharing kit completed end user worksite reduces time eliminates excess cost like shipping handling  continued zakin  may hear  kbps modem available standard defined one know hardware needed comply unique modem architecture make future field upgrade realistic simple procedure  u robotics advanced modular modem architecture company courier vbis courier hst dual standard shared access modem readily upgradable kbps modem made motherboard smaller daughterboard hold modem microprocessor firmware current highspeed daughterboard easily replaced new board containing  kbps ccitt standard u robotics modem

line nt expect sending file top speed immediately dale walsh vice president advanced development u robotics inc caution user wo nt able achieve maximum speed permitted standard right away standard adopted modem conform able transmit  kbps line modem conforming vbis current highspeed standard transmit  kb walsh member ccitt committee developing standard say formulated increasing digitization dialup phone network mind improved quality phone line much modem technology improvement made high speed dialup communication possible  say walsh  designing standard keeping mind phone network use digital circuit digital central office switch  consequently speed neighborhood  kbps exception rather rule  least public switched telephone network becomes completely digital  say finished year standard allow  kbps transmission percent line kbps percent line  kbps communication percent line  say walsh also helped develop ccitt vbis standard  kbps dialup communication  phone network improve top speed easily achieved think realistic think  kbps standard sometimes capable higher speed common misconception coming  kbps standard allow speed  kbps combined vbis data compression walsh noted calculation based assumption vbis allows data compression outside lab vbis allows compression ratio meaning real life condition forthcoming standard allow maximum throughput  kbps  mistake use  number max everything  said walsh  kbps standard nt advantage  kbps improvement  kbps forthcoming standard adjust line condition critical factor highspeed data communication  like previous standard standard development include  probing  function modem use  sound  quality phone line allow modem optimize transmission take advantage available bandwidth  still working training sequence  say walsh  transmission start standard enable modem determine band width available best position signal match available band width  standard achieves higher speed ability use line bandwidth center portion channel used current standard  closely match modulation scheme available  say walsh  way modem shape transmission adapt precisely channel important want transmit high speed recent committee meeting held last month still agreed upon critical issue training sequence coding scheme signaling rate walsh said expects committee reach final agreement official ccitt adoption likely taken calling standard development vlast walsh nt convinced final modem standard note one thought dialup phone line would ever noisefree advance area could make even higher speed dialup communication possible  certain least fax version standard quality phone line keep improving  said  trying sure standard serve user year modem standard like war always think going last one  u robotics inc nasdaq usrx dialusr voice infor
