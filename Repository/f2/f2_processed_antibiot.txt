infection arise implantation subsequent vegetative proliferation blood borne microorganism plateletfibrin deposit generally three condition must present infective endocarditis develop see figure firstly area damaged endocardium provides focus infection process may begin could diseaesd valve structural defect prosthetic valve implant secondly hemodynamic turbulence favour deposition sterile thrombus thirdly bacteremia necessary initiate process since transient bacteremia found elicited invasive dental procedure infective endocarditis occur reasonable method interrupting triad event leading infective endocarditis decrease eliminate effect bacteremia administering regimen prophylactic antibiotic coverage chance developing infective endocarditis subsequent dental procedure related two factor nature dental procedure precipitating bacteremia type heart lesion involved dental procedure produce gingival mucosal hemorrhage likely cause bacteremia thus procedure unlikely produce intraoral hemorrhage doea require antibiotic coverage risk infective endocarditis increase nature dental procedure becomes invasive example extraction cause greater bacteremia prophylaxis cardiac condition vary susceptibility infective endocarditis condition may divided high intermediate low negligible risk category simplicity high risk condition requir special attention endocarditis prophyaxis high incidence infective endocarditis unprotected patient see table included category patient prosthetic heart valve usually require parenteral antibiotic coverage extremely high risk condition category require standard regimen unless otherwise directed patient physician see table intermediate risk condition also require antibiotic covergae see table standard regimen recommended use prophylactic antibiotic low risk condition controversial one hand condition represent risk albeit small one hand investigator calculated risk severe adverse reaction antibiotic covered patient much greater risk infectve andocarditis patient without coverage category condition antibiotic coverage optional therefore element clinical judgement exercised see table instance patient category requires one two simple class ii amalgam would probably need coverage even though degree gingival bleeding would expected procedure however patient poor oral hygiene requires flap curettage perhaps covered diagnosing cardiac condition frequently asked question  patient risk identified  overstress importance good medical history specific question asked concerning past present heart condition rheumatic fever congenital heart defect heart murmur artifical heart valve serious illness hospitilization also noted uneducated patient might appreciate significance information may provide brief medical history medical problem suspected patient physician contacted instance may wise suggest physician patient consult cardiologist patient may like inconvenience genuine concern hisher health appreciated congenital syndrome frequently exhibit cardiac lesion see table patient congenital syndrome investigated cardiac medical condition patient severe multiple cardiac defect may treated safely hospital dental department two major type heart murmur identified see figure functional innocent heart murmur considered benign lesion significant hemodynamic abnormality murmur require antibiotic prophylaxis conversely organic heart murmur pathologic therefore antibiotic coverage recommended using auscultation physician differentiate functional murmur organic murmur occasionally investigation cardiologist may necessary mvp relatively common mitral valve prolapse mvp cardiac condition one leaflet mitral valve billow left atrium end systole relatively common phenomenon occuring four eight per cent population contrary popular belief mvp low risk lesion antibiotic coverage generally required invasive dental procedure ie prophylaxis optional however realted cardiac condition referred mitral valve prolapse syndrome mvp occurs mvp accompanied regurgitation blood back mitral valve mvp condition intermediate risk infective endocarditis therefore antibiotic coverage necessary important note small percentage mvp patient mvp proper diagnosis usually requires advanced diagnostic procedure echocardiography angiocardiography performed cardiologist thorough medical history addition consultation family physician andor cardiologist remove doubt regarding cardiac status patient rheumatic fever factor patient suffered previous attack rheumatic fever cardiac involvement may continuous chemoprophylactic regimen prevent recurrent attack patient susceptible rheumatic fever recurrence especially initial episode occurred early age patient considerable risk developing infective endocarditis longterm prophylactic regimen frequently given patient monthly injection benzathine penicillin g regimen insufficient prevent infective endocarditis thus patient given standard regimen endocarditis prophylaxis addition regular longterm antibiotic therapy since patient longterm penicillin developed resistant strain intraoral bacteria alternate antibiotic used endocarditis

related dental procedure mean however dentallyinduced bacteremia cannotcause infection hydrocephalic shunt although researcher maintain antibiotic coverage required high rate late shunt infection indicates patient must treated caution antibiotic regimen established may indicated patient best contact patient physician andor neurosurgeon determine need antibiotic coverage specific regimen used renal problem create risk two type dialysis utilized treatment endstage renal disease peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis patient undergo peritoneal dialysis require antibiotic coverage dental procedure patient undergoing hemodialysis considered moderate risk must covered standard regimen hemodialysis patient atriovenous shunt created subcutaneously allow frequent readily accessible venipuncture dental bacteremia may cause infection shunt leading endocarditis endarteritis recommended dos penicillin erythromycin acceptable mild meoderate renal failure use streptomycin gentamicin contraindicated metabolized kidney kidney transplant become relatively common surgical procedure many endstage renal patient postoperatively however patient live threat immediate longterm hostgraft rejection thus placed life long immunosuppresive drug regimen ie cyclosporin corticosteroid suppress rejection new tissue result decreased immune response experience delayed wound healing prone infection patient may develop postoperative infection subsequent dental procedure causing bacteremia pateint physician consulted antibiotic coverage prior invasive dental procedure wary sle lesion systematic lupus erythematosus sle disease unknown etiology patient develop autoimmune response connective tissue cell condition characterized presence chronic inflammatory lesion dentist particularly concerned lesion affecting cardiovascular system atypical endocarditis involving heart valve may occur well fibrinoid degeneration epicardium myocardium approximately per cent sle patient experience valvular abnormality addition cardiac abnormality kidney brain lesion resulting progressive degeneration may occur medical treatment sle includes use corticosteroid suppress autoimmune response therefore patient increased incidence infective endocarditis infection consultation patient physician recommended determine extent disease potential associated blood dyscrasia ie thrombocytopenia von willebrand disease platelet dysfunction etc recommended patient covered standard regimen invasive dental procedure blood count often required effectiveness antineoplastic therapy based primarily interfering reproduction rapidly proliferating cell therefore ablation cancer cell also depressant action tissue bone marrow oral mucosa epithelium high rate replication firstly neutropenia render patient incapable mounting effective inflammatory response risk infection rise granulocyte count drop ul peak count le ul secondly lymphocytopenia result humoral cell mediated immune deficiency cumulative effect granulocytopenia lymphocytopenia creates immunosuppressive state patient becomes susceptible myriad bacterial especially gram negative bacillus ie pseudomonas fungal ie candida viral ie herpes simplex varicella zoster infection potential infection enhanced oral epithelium normally act natural barrier damaged therefore damaged area present portal entry microorganism bloodstream
