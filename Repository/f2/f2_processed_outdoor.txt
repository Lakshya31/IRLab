select planting strongest seedling started strongest argument method risk transporting seedling intended site transporting requires find method concealing usually box problem arises size box needed transport many plant may make method risky totally impractical concern method also risk shocking seedling put outside site exposed harsh spring weather planting seedling sexed female put outside closely monitored least three day planting become acclimated wind change temperature method work best set small shelter near site enclosed insulated shelter small site inch tall big enough walk providing safe location structure starting seed shelter give benefit acclimating seedling temperature much closer face planted site also protect late spring snow andor frost c planting sexed female advantage planting sexed female obvious every plant produce bud sex plant determined growing four inch high decreasing amount light receive eight hour male identified removed one two week method requires able control amount light plant receive day also requires plant started indoors earlier would normally start late february early march method allows grower spread plant across wide area smaller site also hide plant amongst small tree shrub spreading two dozen female plant throughout ten acre area individual site harvest almost guaranteed providing remember site grower encouraged create map site insure memory loss remember guard map closely putting anything operation writing put risk weeding three week plant seed ground return remove weed crowding kind erb three week first weeding second weeding take place third weeding optional time plant large enough compete weed however site strong weed around may cut weed back additional time throughout year remember weeding mean destroying vegetation within three foot plant weed help hide crop protect crop hungry animal nearby vegetation also help keep water soil evaporating hot sun nt go overboard careful easy accidently
