spell must actually augment perception certain limited way research continues divinatory invisibility nondetection extremely useful spell value personal privacy yet achieved mageclass status master third circle indeed several wizard known use spell combination extension order provide continuous coverage casting spell provides complete resistance scrying sort well spell like esp detection divinationtype spell campaign also prevents aura reading like know alignment amulet many similar item known although resulting rnull reading often least much provoke suspicion information may

fact creature clearly seen unless powerful magic like true seeing employed detect invisibility therefore reveal general detail rough size build biped humanoid monstrous etc rogue often find result extremely convenient assassin treat special effect like natural detection ability certain powerful creature therefore albeit chance success one extremely valuable aspect spell ability foil magical
