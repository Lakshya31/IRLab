computer graphic hint improve graphic  hint would like improve technique making illustration example painting title screen amiga would like stress point article turn instant artist subject technique art computer medium creating graphic builtin problem however let known medium oilpaint watercolour ink crayon mention many shortcoming limitation shortcoming computer painting limited number colour ii creating gradual shading flow colour iii putting extremely small detail iv step effect created line angle v expression material eg hair vi screen canvas size problem along others dealt course article creating working disk nt want go trouble creating formatted blank disk directory image make enough disk space disk painting programme save creation choosing object care taken choosing object painted two biggest pitfall small detail need many colour start choosing painting one two object help cope limited number colour disposal exercise would choose flower flower single colour basically need two colour one flower one stem leaf colour left depending resolution using later devoted shading highlight shadow transfer object screen suggest copy existing illustration start enough technical problem without creating artistic one well chosen object copy get outline detail onto screen painting photograph postcard magazine book faced problem transferring image screen preferably without damage original program like degas elite gridtool help create screen look like graph paper using gridtool create grid vertical horizontal line approximately mm apart screen get grid degas elite go back screen count number whole square top bottom count incomplete block top bottom next go back picture measure height divide height number vertical square counted screen example picture height mm number square screen divide mm screen square mm divide picture drawing vertical line mm apart wish damage picture stretch sheet tracing paper top line work tracing paper number row block along top starting placing one block left number row vertical block left hand side starting placing one block top number one common vertical horizontal row block go back screen freehandtool write number corresponding picture make sure numbered grid centre screen finding middle line screen nt forget part palette row block right left centered grid deleted picture happens horizontal block screen decide part picture horizontally important however happen often draw outline detail looking picture drawing line corresponding block number top bottom screen picture help identify corresponding blocksthe mouse ideal tool drawing outline perfect chosen face head make sure important detail eye nose right place finished outline detail remove grid line using background colour use colour case black background creamwhite brown line work grid line background colour black likely interfere colour picture white line work hard eye choosing pixel size much choice  unless use something like spectrum got colour lore start first picture would recommend using lore surprise surprise interference adjacent colour useful dot white red next result pink two white dot one red dot side give white pink edge five shade grey one red basic colour result colour red shade grey combination red grey combination grey leave figure total number combination possible colour choosing palette choice palette probably important step bad choice colour result continuous struggle colour interference adjacent colour lore care taken ensure besides basic colour chosen object shade lighter darker make easier create shadow highlight computer programme feature called  range  specify darkest colour say colour away lightest colour programme select inbetween colour modify degas palette check doc also covered art package like neo take pick colour changed alter colour rgbcontrols colour changed care taken colour basic background lettering border note amiga user get used lot colorsbecause colour available u important every colour used create several colour example white dark green could cut need light green experimentation free part screen help decide know going paint give typical palette contain black white least following shade grey brown since grey brown strong easily overshadowed prime colour red blue yellow effect result darker lighter shade prime colour essential good shadow work highlight detail creating masterpiece stage outline picture palette wish use spraypaint tool time use spray painting effective background choose  spread  big limit numb er dot give background basic colour want spray desired pattern use  masking  major object limited spread small number dot prevent many unwanted dot getting object also staying away object imitating spray pattern close using single pixel brush help using one spray colour use darker spray bottom lighter one top dark colour work foundation however use spray sky darker colour go top give painting depth filling next step use fillin tool make sure break gap outline check break using magnifyingtool overlooked gap part painting nt want fillin get filledin use undo remove close gap try fillingin basic colour check detail place shading obtained using progression colour sometimes better result obtained using basic colour progression darker brown dot red yellow green grey dot white blue cost time create checkered pattern could example made red brown square progressively using darker brown red also darken influence brown brown dot ca nt seen red mo dominant colour appear red get darker creating illusion shadow using two shade red extend range light dark even typical annoying feature computer graphic line angle curve little step step eliminated putting intermediate colour example object step red background colour black put brown dot corner step ragged outline smoothed said seen scrutinizing two painting disk painting medres transferred painting programme looked magnifyingtool backup finally would like advise save work hour also end day work make backup copy detailed painting take several day complete lose painting memory disk failure disheartening nt know  end painthints  tex painthintspart series st news disc magazine erik exception fourth part highly popular series time e talk graphictricks like transparent graphic antialiasing like hi de hi reader gained enough energy yet another round textips part nt even need specific assembler knowledge since mainly cover personal field expertise graphic might think rather little left said many page book well magazine filled subject already nt sure le rare trick tip nt know anything familiar antialiasing animated graphic palette animation transparent effect backand foreground scrolling without programming trouble nt know anything soon read additionally tell something  neochrome  drawing program surely nt know like earlier episode series thing said refer low resolution st normally use colour reader st news volume issue course chuckle lightly well let start talk subject listed systematically antialiasing listed first commonly used professional circle computer graphic artist freely interpreted would mean  heck avoid gradation computer picture  know st like colleaguehomecomputers fairly limited screen resolution mean especially diagonal line circle show typical gradation since fool hardware case simply fool another peripheral human eye hereby use way eye see contrast antialiasing one us following scheme boundary two colour one insert dot gradation colour two colour use demonstrate remarkable effect please make little practical exercise surely drawing program zoom function load define following colour background color drawing color drawing color drawing color drawing color draw triangle drawing colour therefore draw three line example upper left corner position x position x back x back upper left hand corner fill well drawing color bright red triangle screen right side clearly demonstrates typical gradation copy triangle two triangle next screen second one anti aliased enter zoom mode select drawing color put one dot color stair gradation right side triangle select drawing color third time drawing color added three darkening red color every gradation leave zoom mode look effect difference quite stunning nt second triangle seems displayed much higher resolution first one antialiasing quite simple like experiment bit draw filled circle drawing color put darkening shade red gradation step also develop feeling put number antialiasingdots since circle contains different gradation size using technique graphic enhanced color palette properly designed example black background color bright red drawing color  antialiasing color fun experimenting effect next ah color palette animation first let start small explanation actually st sixteen color register swapped cyclic way called color cycling palette animation often used simulate flowing water one oldest  neochrome  picture  waterfall  typical example case shade blue contained water swapped circle much possibility palette animation always dubious pleasure creating effect many people considered graphic programming nice application technique found tex program  super neo demo show  scrolling text lower border screen lot small propeller introduction probably surprised hear rotating line nothing palette animation many people initially explained trick done well quite difficult put word like love ex ed give try imagine drawn line cross one another middle line color set color black one exception one color remains eg black middle put small circle nonanimating color cover part line cross let color cycle impression rotating line since one line displayed red time trick kind eg hopping dot nd psychoscreen  big demo  principally use trick used color put background color colored palette animation movement start one use extend animated figure eg little man walk across screen method draw movement phase color time set next overlap since men light due color animation appears though shape walk across screen true animation effect thus accomplished animating color disadvantage trick obvious use lot color color animation left rest picture one decision well dear reader really starting previous classified among harmless toying around really cookin maybe seen graphic seemed like transparent glass seemed float program maybe wondered wonderful difficult program sat behind ha wrong suppose used also covered sleazy trick understand must know something graphic buildup st mention short refresh memory low resolution look like certain piece memory referred screen memory four sequential memory word word bit always belong together word represents socalled plane best imagine four word lying way see best pixel represented four bit according combination bit color value taken one sixteen color register resolution x  pixel pixel take one color plane therefore kb size st graphic screen thus cost kb plane used represent color truly look upon plane use like programtechnically interesting aspect let presume made piece graphic us eight color color realised plane stacked bit mean combination possible color found color register one plane left plane example possible display piece graphic us one color set color register  value move piece graphic one plane program us fourth word corresponding bit combination give color register  possible put singlecolor piece graphic top one color without difficult logical operation oh hear call  transparent effect foreand background eh  well programtechnical nothing else happens described else simple brainmangling thought setting proper color palette transparentas well backand foreground effect realised simply setting proper color palette therefore must thoroughly realise happening bit combination piece graphic one plane moved three others color result corresponding effect always last eight number  color located called corresponding bit combination located color appear separate plane moved three word fourth bit fourth plane set cleared understand easy think way create transparent effect simply put intermediate color upper half palette correspond brightness eight program example present disk program folder file bright red plate glass move background pattern us shade grey color hereby set follows color  black along shade grey white transparent color  go dark red yellow one color graphic block fourth plane go three plane color appears used appear used appear etc programtechnically speaking simple nt even talked udo others also quite blabbergasted came idea believe whole backand foreground business much look big scroller  big demo  scrolling text scroll foreand background effect one set upper eight color follows color onecolored piece graphic go behind set corresponding upper color color covered graphic block get value want move front want oneplane graphic block move background three plane one set upper color exactly lower one really simple think hmm might right everything get last thing possible st nt effect also quite simple put word sigh exed look listing program folder last doubt disappear program following build background pattern three plane thus using first eight color make graphic block fourth plane move fro using key  possible call different color palette support description pressing key following effect realised key palette onecolored block move graphic key palette block move background key palette block move pattern key palette transparent block move graphic fun trying easy use color palette extremely funny effect created way almost made end issue  wizard  article end found necessary make plea nothing like  tortured st user everywhere get together  much favourite drawing program many others think one grotesquely underestimated program st talking  neochrome  supplied atari st early day version  supposed sold better version  never properly marketed salesman also considered  public domain every st user could get program reason program gut explained little tell something program probably nt know basis actually brief  neochrome  already includes almost function one would need creating good picture unnecessary function present fast fast several function would even make  degas elite  look rather basic drawn picture admit important tool zoom mode contrary drawing program available  neochrome  zoom mode always present also operate block draw line fill etc zoom mode fast way us raster interrupt jackknife function allows cut whatever form want polygon also moved background  dpaint ii  amiga ca nt even suppose already know function implemented  neochrome  menu talk function obvious might surprise many thing example hidden right mouse button normal block menu current block set current position jackknife draw pressing right button like brush unlike program also happens fast brush mode pressing right mouse button take care draw color installed color arrow also case using nozzle highly effective using color animation grabber mode get color every pixel screen want pressing right mouse button line mode current line deleted press right button left one doubleclicking right mouse button eraser icon entire screen erased hot tip since people know complete animation tool  neochrome  dave staugas programmer time make completely bugfree hid way get new icon screen go grabber mode click right mouse button precisely curve last r word grabber appear right side menu small camera appears following selecting camera define animation area mouse right mouse button slide whole picture area right part simply click add part picture animation memory add many picture want slide cutout back first cutout dave know use arrow play animation forward well backwards del possible delete current screen load save also work nt get startled fileselector box busted stop animation experiment little animation tool unlike animation tool st one easy use biggest advantage edit figure animated right drawing program warned new menu option bug free example quite smart press undo key make menu disappear camera selected probably better save picture enter animation tool old st demo flying parrot load without problem forget load accompanying picture shore landscape regard color palette finally little gag define color menu started  neochrome  look file called  neocmp  word color value need replace preset palette intend use  neochrome  often future look heart give good ol dave something trouble really good program currently system programmer atari quite disappointed fact excellent program nt treated accordingly magazine even talking lousy marketing financial contribution sent atari corporation personal mr dave staugas borregas avenue sunnyvale california  usa  neochrome  fan falter dave wrote consider rewriting old source stuff making better  neochrome  version fanmail accordingly beg well dear reader told trick crown work hardwaretorturing yet come hereby talking getting rid lower border graphic displayed well using trick
