honda use stab carefully easy honda hit perhaps jab time kick retreat honda torpedo block jump dodge backflip honda try corner hand jump throw ca nt stop hand time rolling claw use long distance opponent get ready jump away since hand come soon caution diving attack make sure land behind honda headbutt land behind backdrop slash least trick vary wall jump good trick jump wall behind opponent turn around land behind grin vega v zangief trick keep zangief away jab strong upward slash vary timing jab zangief may hit armclaw spin use roundhouse slide rolling claw done distance screaming eagle

honest throwing constant jab strong claw attack key patient attacking us several medium kick kick try sneak sliding roundhouse throw sonice boom sometimes jump annoy little usually block however screaming eagle attack fake guile player blade kick bu jumping wall landing short many time tense guile release bladekick allowing walk slam  head wall behind guile nt turn around air slam land short slam guile nt blade kick move definate advantage sometimes jump wall without attacking slam opponent land next sometimes risky vega v bison first move almost always strong slash keep bison torpedoing even blitzkick keep strong slash varying roundhouse jumping kick get right shoudl ususally kick bison flaming torpedo way away torpedo kick  b screaming eagle attack backslam get torpedo aim location behind hard bison counter however see bison start another torpedo direct safe spot land torpedo block within inch reach corner use strong throw slam otherwise try jumping away blocking recommend jumping awayalthough perhaps back flipping may work vega v sagat argh tough one high low tiger make hard time come attack one sagat hit take like make keep stabbing may get hit tiger worse b get hit tiger uppercut alot distance may try jumping wall landing way short draw sagat tiger uppercut time well jump tiger use roundhouse kick strong hit retreat fast jump tiger slam sagat risky good sagat give problem tiger uppercut much deadly ryu ken hell move nasty vega v blanka bad matchup vega blanka win air almost every time unless jump early roundhouse jump attack case hit also jump straight fierce slap standing fierce claw hit ball attack stopped kicking risky nt even think screaming eagle blanka seems good defending best land safely continuous thrusting claw mean getting ball face top blanka heavy damage per hit find incapable matching damag easily  really like hit one blanka alot faster sagat best option sacrifice throw alot mean getting blanka jump taking roundhouse hit slamming well everything learned far one cool trick though know opponent coming tick rolling claw hit make think ticking next time grin bison flaming torpedo guile sonic boom motion jab short distance fierce long distance hit blocked using fierce scorpion head stomp followed rounded punch guile whipkick start flying air followed kick button stand opponent head followed fierce push joystick toward person best result double foward kick guile sonic boom kick button length flight dependant upon kick button pushed major slide roundhouse throw character throw   vega personal favorite  screamin eagle  guile whipkick corner corner fly scream fierce spread eagle followed backbreaker sometimes stun note crouch left sonic kick left corner jump left wall crouch left sonic kick right corner jump right wall claw roll guile sonic boom crouch forward puch button highly effective close hit time almost like blanka ball bison buster regular jump kick bison torpedo move air jump kick even punch button ground
