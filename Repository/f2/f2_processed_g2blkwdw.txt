described  cross robotron centipede played vector monitor  also good lot fun black widow board cute little sticker em board peel back sticker greeted neat surprise actually gravitar board disguise okay control panel little different  might want add two fourdirectional joystick gravitar panel might want add five button black widow panel considering save trouble buying whole new cabinet small price pay gotten control panel way still remains subject board simple rom swap trick wo nt help much want switch back forth regular basis looking either lot rom swapping finding new board plug one method timeconsuming potentially damaging component requires considerable hardware investment would nt nice matter flicking switch swapping control panel bother swapping army rom game held single chip people designed multicarts home video game system ca nt idea applied unlike home game arcade game early ran proprietary hardware architecture unique game game turn however multicart technology applied rare instance one end project two small daughterboards small connector plugging daughterboards socket main board soldering wire connector onto test point also main board give ability convert back
