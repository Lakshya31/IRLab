campaign organization grassroots group sea shepherd green peace earth first link road animal liberation campaign live export hunt sabs campaign criminal injustice act  demonstration protest  blockade occupation moved would want prevent moved moving major tactic direct action moving method used successfully prevent thing happening missile entering base road live animal loaded onto ship export tree cut building demolished etc practically impossible prevent moved however method used varying success mean delay inevitable delay cost opposition considerable sum money result victory sit down sit in sitting often used method prevent demonstration moved work seems increasingly ineffective case naive think sitting position make significantly difficult forcibly moved however require lot people move large crowd people sitting also take long time time take move people area people already moved opportunity move back sit unless great number police security etc prevent happening sitting work opposition really want moved take time lot people linking arm linking arm protester object also make removing protester difficult mean greater effort required move protester may also requires people certainly mean take longer time clear protester however also invite violence greater chance injury protester used advantage lot reporter camera around violence nonviolent protest make good publicity chain handcuff people nt like pain used opposition trying detached protester thing clinging whether protester object like railing bending back thumb finger etc usually result grip loosed given voluntarily stop pain prevent occurring protester sometimes chain handcuff thing method particularly effective since usually done small number protester unchained protester finally removed opposition free use bolt cutter hacksaw remove chained protester perhaps cost hardware prevents technique used large number even large crowd protester handcuff around lamp post etc eventually cuff would cut expensive delaying tactic point view protester hibred system used great effect group link road campaign hibred system successfully delay removal protester basic principle system place protester way choice leave effort force leave dangerous either protester better still opposition protester one method use handcuffing tactic way make virtually impossible get handcuff order remove take plastic pipe large enough diameter place entire arm inside drive metal rod pipe plastic pipe pass though right angle place object something large cumbersome cement least one end pipe free place arm take careabena hook used rock climbing sailing etc fix wrist strong comfortable bind rope place arm pipe hock onto metal bar unhook anyone else wish move either move object time must take apart object unhook carry away attached smaller part object another method used link road campaign impressive scaffold tower built onto roof house trying protect demolished tower tall cherry picker crane opposition usually used remove protester occupying pile driver etc could reach protester tower proved dangerous send normal police officer tower remove protester end cold weather lack food water made final protester come voluntarily incredible day eviction attempt  contamination vandalism many method used past doubt others used future used form direct action method effective mean economic sabotage method discussed also used immoral end personal gain tree spiking tree spiking involves hammering big nail tree ring around stem would expect cut tactic pointless dangerous used without warning worker company tree spiked saw hit one nail spike people imeadiate area may injured flying fragment one celebrated case mill worker injured actually ended sueing loggin company negligence said lumberjack u killed trying cut spiked tree however incident apparently urban myth encouraged establishment aim tree spiking harm logger create potential damage expensive saw blade mill cost upwards  presenting logging company potential loss money may encourage leave spiked section forest alone pelt painting used economic sabotage form direct action attracted great medium attention public support early eighty culling seal pub made economically le viable activist group like sea shepherd used indelible dy paint fur baby seal although coloring may wrecked baby seal camouflage also wrecked economic value pelt product contamination tactic used occasionally group animal liberation movement also used greedy individual attempt make quick buck blackmail product sold opposition contaminated way rendering unsellable consumable product food drink claimed contamination could anything mercury rat poison etc razor blade broken glass animal liberation activist prefer substance like salt produce unpleasant taste produce ill effect someone actually consume often claim made product contaminated really nothing done hoax often effective economic sabotage real thing hoax may quite elaborate real contaminated product sent medium aid illusion  window glass plate glass window found shop etc cheap destroying effective method economic sabotage true vehicle window also expensive replace window also possible mean entry building vehicle burglar activist involved animal liberation quite adept breaking window number way advantage disadvantage blow torch used burglar blow torch used heat window glass cold water applied example damp cloth cold water cause hot glass crack much quietly using brick masking tape sticky paper blitz second world war people put masking tape window prevent glass shattering everywhere bomb blast occur nearby today masking tape sticky paper etc used activist prevent broken glass making lot noise fall also help prevent mess broken glass causing injury enter building catapult catapult hard heavy object marble ball bearing stone used mean break window distance purpose economic sabotage catapult purchased easily shop lifted fishing tackle shop glass etching fluid used activist animal liberation movement glass etching fluid quiet method economic sabotage usually used butcher window car windscreen belonging company individual involved animal abuse sticker poster graffiti sticker available use adhesive difficult remove glass sticker used area window car park noparking area poster graffiti usually removed window without much effort fairly quickly one method slowing removal slogan poster also necessitating need replace glass glue sheet glass poster slogan directly onto window glass probably popular action since may difficult achieve also time consuming spring loaded center punch spring loaded center punch tool used make dent metal using drill make hole unlike normal center punch need hit hammer since spring loaded requires little effort tool used car stereo thief also adopted alf activist like keith mann break window easily quickly bought decent hardware store privacy keeping secret age national computer database video surveillance camera dna fingerprinting eroding civil right ever increasing police power privacy individual seriously risk however technology help deprive people privacy may help regain citizen movement question authority challenge status quo possibility interest threatened attempt monitor action may done order ascertain danger posed identify individual involved discover way reduce effectiveness movement possible destroy communication member movement perhaps useful opposition come surprise phone taping intercepting mail amongst method commonly used citizen movement thankfully method used help minimize problem traditional method far fool proof hardly convenient inconvenient fact doubtful used many great degree tapped phone spoken code making phone call form code could implemented substituting incriminating word innocent one also disguising sensitive information like time date place producing effective flexible code difficult rather like trying invent new language people meant understand code must taught use information working code must passed private must allowed fall wrong hand time since message past previous future would compromised code also cumbersome use restrictive easy crack unless code changed frequently intercepted mail written cypher slightly harder crack le restrictive would use written message manualy encrypted sent post safe method passing key still necessary manual encryption cumbersome use drawback may make method impractical use routinely used could appear highly suspicious even opposition could imeadiately understand message might interest raised sufficiently stepup surveillance putting resourses cracking code computer encryption left computer military standard encryption algorithm may used virtually impossible crack flexible fast easy use since easy use used routinely would additional suspicion raised regardless importance actual message encryption offer solution problem phone tapping mail interception conventional method problem decipher message requires recipient key used sender encrypt sender recipient get opportunity meet face face key exchanged however situation safe channel available public key cryptology public key cryptology provides solution person using system two related key one secret one public public key distributed freely nt mater fall hand opposition possessing public key enable anyone deduce corresponding secret key secret key must kept secure however case fall wrong hand best system add protection requiring passphrase known owner whenever key used sending message sender encrypt using public key belonging intended recipient resulting encrypted file sent electronic mail disk standard post encrypted message read anyone even public key person matching secret key passphrase system also provides message authentication sender secret key used encrypt message thereby signing creates digital signature message anyone check using sender public key decrypt prof sender true originator message message subsequently altered anyone else forgery feasible sender later disown signature privacy authentication provided first signing message encrypting recipient public key recipient revers step first decrypting message secret key checking enclosed signature sender public key advanced algorithm used public key cryptology conventional singlekey cryptology may practically uncrackable potentially help solve problem phone tapping mail interception however system free u threat infiltration stupidity even intended recipient encrypted message person read person careless trustworthy hoped sender effort wasted pretty good privacy
