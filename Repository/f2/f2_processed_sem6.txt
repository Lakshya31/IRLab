 tesla shield  particular interest hemispherical shell energy year ago dubbed  tesla shield  two scalar hemispherical surface created using multiple frequency transmitter truncated fourier series expansion interference two scalar hemisphere creates great glowing hemispherical shell ordinary electromagnetic energy shell energy density sufficient lift dirac matter dirac sea vacuum shell thus filled glowing plasma shell may several hundred mile diameter base enormous energy required form defense shell obtained  scalar power tap  molten core earth previously explained late aprilearly may  power tap  placed earth soviet tap capable powering large scalar em weapon soviet strategic scalar em arsenal contains monstrous superweapons capable generating exothermic explosion endothermic explosion engineering weather locating destroying underwater submarine detecting destroying ballistic missile shortly launch detecting destroying long range strategic bomber soon airborne etc rate giant tesla shield useful penetrating vehicle shell large energy density may high case intense plasma heating fuse even vaporize metallic body addition vehicle encountering shell subjected extremely intense emp arising everywhere inside circuitry emp shielding use creation energy throughout spacetime circuit shielding help energy flow space conventional sense thus electronics vehicle encountering shield instantly dudded whether shielded ordinary electromagnetic interference emi includes electronics operating nuclear warhead carried reentry vehicle electrically everything penetrating shell totally dudded explosive material exploded emp encountered combustible material fiercely consumed set afire ablative shielding suffers interesting catastrophe since energy try  flow  shielding  arises  everywhere simultaneously  ablation  occurs everywhere throughout ablative material simply exploding instantly addition smaller tesla shell say mile diameter energy density sufficient melt vaporize metal missile structure tesla shield need discriminate true warhead bearing reentry vehicle decoy chaff etc whole  mess  entering shield simply  cleaned   sterilized  destroyed shield take care

active september producing large tesla globe dew saryshagan produce giant luminous tesla globe almost certainly scalar em interferometer produce giant tesla shield well downie reported earlier sighting similar phenomenon seen afghan deep within soviet union direction toward saryshagan  briefly let u cover us giant globe spherical shell glowing em energy plasma placing giant globe hundred mile away defended heartland entire arc sky defended long range ballistic missile attack midcourse midcourse trajectory attacking missile would penetrate globular shell twice exposing giant internal emps twice high probability thus exists missile entering space occupied globe dudded upon entry andor exit includes electronics inside nuclear warhead also particularly effective mirv marv missile carrier since multiple reentry vehicle normally still main vehicle midcourse use midcourse abm globe defense greatly reduces number vehicle arriving latter part midcourse terminal phase trajectory using smaller intense globe placing incoming cluster object single object emp local heating used object suitable latter part midcourse terminal phase icbm irbms slbms cruise missile also useful incoming strategic bomber air surface missile ballistic cruise two mode globe  especially small one  used first continuous mode used  fry  vaporize incoming object relatively small volume say ten fifteen mile diameter second  pulse  mode used  service  incoming object whether passed  large globe  midcourse defense provides additional guarantee killing object discrimination require get exposure incoming object multiple attack raise probability kill essentially close one wish course incoming vehicle may still encounter terminal defense consisting tesla shield associated roving  quickshot  small intense globe short system essentially abm anti bomber defense possible soviet possessed effective defense two decade openly stated since khrushchev announced  superweapons   continuous tesla emp globe  another verified incident gigantic test soviet scalar em howitzer deep within soviet union cia report released freedom information act one quite sure incident occurred stated phenomenon

enormous size dimming literally filling arc distant sky expanded sighting shielded ground observer view airport due intervening mountain range masked phenomenon ground silent expanding globe observed four five minute faded away positive evidence testing giant scalar interferometer  midcourse abm globe  type action however note date  mid soviet therefore testing scalar weapon enormous size power least two decade implies development must started least decade earlier mid still earlier january nikita khrushchev announced development  fantastic  soviet weapon one could even destroy life earth unrestrainedly used ebullient khrushchev forced back lose face john kennedy cuban missile crisis khrushchev missile bomber woeful shape kennedy well knew courtesy russian spy colonel oleg penkovsky kennedy know khrushchev new superweapons nearing deployment quite ready yet save face prevent immediate ouster khrushchev apparently conducted startling twostrike demonstration new weapon soon became operationally ready april detected destroyed us thresher nuclear submarine using scalar em howitzer underwater  continuous  mode next day demonstrated  pulsed  underwater destruction mode underwater

unnoticed disregarded even though seen reported fbi u coast guard passing u jetliner pilot crew observed underwater explosion thus peg development weapon soviet starting well first operational deployment gigantic strategic weaponry occurred early note testing observed completely consistent estimated development schedule thus large soviet strategic scalar em weapon operational site year implies least three additional generation scalar em weapon developed deployed   mysterious light north pacific  incident soviet testing tesla shield tesla globe weapon routinely observed airline pilot

essentially continue way see incident involving small intense tesla globe kind defense could  service  object already penetrated large midcourse globe aircraft approaching defended area obviously soviet authority tracking aircraft knew vicinity seems logical deliberately placed brightly glowing ball beneath aircraft pilot crew could fail observe strange message pilot simply designed increase
