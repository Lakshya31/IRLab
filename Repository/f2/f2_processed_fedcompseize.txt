people use target computer equipment one people give permission search data agent may generally rely consent long person authority computer case user assumed risk couser might discover everything computer might also permit law enforcement discover  common area  well page united state v matlock u supreme court stated one common authority premise effect may consent search even absent couser object important footnote court said  common authority  property law concept rest rather mutual use property person generally joint access control purpose reasonable recognize coinhabitants right permit inspection right others assumed risk one number might permit common area searched id n extending analysis third party common authority may consent even antagonistic toward defendant one could even argue sharing access common premise unsympathetic person would objectively increase risk disclosure thus reasonable expectation privacy actually diminish especially true consenting individual agrees search common premise exculpate defendant criminal activity see w lafave search seizure treatise fourth amendment  b  ed see also united state v long fd th cir wife fear husband could still consent search jointly owned house even though moved changed lock two people enjoy equal property right place may still exclusive private zone within shared premise housemate separate bedroom spouse private area container housemate separate directory shared computer may reasonably expect space alone individual expectation overcome another common authority premise property although bright line test court generally regard defendant claim exclusive control situation skepticism see frazier v cupp u even court may honor claim privacy defendant taken special step protect personal effect scrutiny others others lack ready access w lafave supra  f  united state v block fd th cir fourth circuit page held mother authority permit police officer inspect yearold son room include locked footlocker room court stated authority consent search thought automatically extend interior every discrete enclosed space capable search within area  common experience  teach u law  enclosed space   mankind

discrete expectation privacy respect particular object whether secured whether commonly used preserving privacy etc  id n cf united state v sealey fd th cir spousal consent valid sealed container marked way would indicate defendant sole ownership thus creating separate personal directory computer may sufficiently mark exclusive protecting separate directory secret password may  lock container  event law enforcement analyst search directory breaking password couser consented search know password court would probably suppress result matlock address whether consent search valid police reasonably mistakenly relied upon consent someone appeared common authority premise fact illinois v rodriguez u however supreme court held consent search valid police reasonable thinking given authorized consent court cautioned however police simply rely upon someone scene claim authority surrounding circumstance indicate otherwise authority unclear police obligated ask question determining power consent objective exercise court stated test whether page fact available police officer moment would warrant person reasonable caution believe consenting party authority premise id  b spouse matlock  common authority  approach spousal consent search valid although spouse create exclusive area may preclude partner consenting search circumstance unusual indeed spouse establish  exclusive use  one us area must showing consenting spouse denied access w lafave supra p  united state v duran fd  th cir example defendant wife lived farm several outbuilding wife consented search building believed defendant used private gym police found marijuana plant inside court emphasized presumption entire marital premise jointly held controlled partner said presumption overcome showing consenting

consent absence objective evidence contrary agent reasonable presuming spouse authority consent search anything marital property illinois v rodriguez supra c parent recent computer crime case perpetrator relatively young even longer legally minor resided parent matlock rationale clear parent may consent search common area family home additionally regard minor child court found parent hold superior right page home  even rather extraordinary effort child establish exclusive use may effective undermine parent authority home including room occupied child  w lafave supra p  b therefore parent consent search seizure floppy disk password locked minor child room consent upheld issue becomes complicated however son daughter reside parent adult situation court may reach opposite result practical matter adult child established exclusive area home parent respected id see discussion united state v block supra p  employer employer may either public ie government private distinction important government employer unlike private employer bound fourth amendment construing reach fourth amendment workplace supreme court held government employer may search employee office without either warrant consent employee search administrative nature workrelated eg supervisor need find case file involves workrelated misconduct oconnor v ortega u court found government employee reasonable expectation privacy even though physical area owned government id specifically rejecting contention made solicitor general public employee never reasonable expectation privacy place work reality workplace however suggest employee expectation privacy must reduced degree fellow employee supervisor subordinate guest even general public may access individual work space recognizing government agency could function properly supervisor establish probable cause obtain warrant whenever needed look file employee office supreme court held two kind search exempt specifically noninvestigatory workrelated intrusion investigatory search evidence suspected workrelated employee misfeasance permissible without warrant judged standard reasonableness id  page even court made clear  n ot everything pass confines business address considered part workplace context   id example content employee purse briefcase closed luggage lose private character employee brought work thus circumstance may permit supervisor search employee desk workrelated file supervisor usually stop employee gym bag briefcase analysis may interesting implication  container  like floppy disk certainly may either workrelated private depending circumstance probably reasonable employer assume floppy disk found office part workplace may case court treat floppy disk personal container private item course may government agency employee consent either expressly tacitly search even private parcel nature job example employee security clearance work classified material may expect purse briefcase bag may inspected certain circumstance factual variation  reasonable expectation  theme endless tied absolutely detail case oconnor court address appropriate standard applied government employee investigated criminal misconduct breach nonworkrelated statutory regulatory standard id case involving employee drug testing least one court noted dictum  government may take advantage arguably relaxed employer standard warrantless search  true purpose obtain evidence criminal activity without complying stringent standard normally protect citizen unreasonably intrusive evidencegathering  national federation federal employee v weinberger fd n dc cir therefore would appear whenever law enforcement conducting evidencegathering search even search take place government office agent must either obtain warrant fall within generally recognized exception warrant requirement appropriate consent third party course one exception generally speaking employer government private may consent search employee computer peripheral employer page common authority agent prosecutor must consider whether fact employee would expect privacy item whether expectation would objectively reasonable relevant factor include whether areaitem searched set aside employee exclusive personal use eg employee key computer others access data employee given permission store personal information system area searched employee advised system may accessed looked others past inspection areaitem fact known employee employment policy search work area may conducted time reason employer federal government another factor whether purpose search workrelated rather primarily law enforcement objective see generally oconnor u employee expectation privacy must assessed context employment relationship currently case specifically addressing employer consent search seize employee computer related item case discus search employee designated work area desk example seventh circuit upheld search hotel room served welfare hotel business office hotel owner consented united state v bilanzich fd th cir room searched used defendantmanager hotel hotel business hotel book stored room also used doctor welfare official visited resident manager kept key room affirming manager theft forgery conviction based large part document seized business officehotel room seventh circuit found hotel owner requisite control relationship business office consent search court rejected manager argument sole control business office generally key finding owner could request access room time room shared others visiting physician welfare official item sought business record eg welfare check manager forged thus manager exclusive control area personal use addition purpose search  employment related  since manager defrauding employer customer page united state v gargiso fd cir second circuit upheld search locked wiredoff area basement book company  search highest official book company scene company vice president consented

government employee finding search employee desk violated employee right privacy court found employee exclusive use desk reasonable expectation privacy employer consent police search desk make search

troublesome employee computer standalone container account large network server difficulty practical one physical world individual often intuitively understand right control physical space restrict

necessarily mean probable cause seize entire computer system ie computer connected peripheral device indeed component computer system considered independently strictly corporeal world doctrine easy understand apply example suppose defendant stole television placed television stand lawfully owned agent warrant television would seize stand recognizing two item easily separable simply put justification taking stand computer role different attached component always separable difficult think concrete term example agent warrant seize target workstation may discover workstation nothing dumb terminal evidence server dumb terminal connected wire page nonetheless simply unacceptable suggest item connected target device automatically seizable era increased networking kind approach lead absurd result networked environment computer contains relevant evidence may connected hundred computer localarea network lan spread throughout floor building university campus lan may also connected globalarea network gan internet taken logical extreme  take connected  theory mean given case thousand machine around world seized target machine share internet obviously proper approach better view seize piece equipment necessary basic inputoutput ie computer plus keyboard monitor government successfully execute warrant agent prepare warrant device list component articulate independent basis search seizure ie component contraband instrumentality evidence certainly independent component doctrine mean connected device exempt requires agent prosecutor articulate reason taking item wish seize
