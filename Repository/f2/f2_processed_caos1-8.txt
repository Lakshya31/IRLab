prime writer particular richard watt lot work sorcerer pan tang recent book despite ken st andre sterling work stormbringer get impression game really missed lot world elric involved writing material game commented lot material presented rule simply gel kind close reading book know approached writing new rule aim starting book much greater extent looked current rule relation literature attempted improve guess important indicate far aware aim new elric rule create rqlike game setting create better reflection elric world  detail magic draft elric rule first thing noticed minimum pow requirement people able use magic way written seems indicate le pow one cast magic  given chracter generation based roll would mean large number character would able use magic background section suggested occupation described set three possibly appropriate spell third one seems almost always  another spell chosen personal speciality  point however magic seen tie reign melniboneans chaotic taint repulse much society gain chaos point spell take background justify seems pretty clear spell required even intended use character back magic section four type magic described hint could easily type magic example  east  detailed four type spell summoning invocation enchantment spell related time minor magic required call upon power greater definite similarity battle magic runequest however better set atmospheric description us seems buzzard eye flame kakatal liken shape rat vision example name interesting disruption healing shield summoning powerful thing would seem rule state activity significant potentially dangerous rule provided precisely people play whole process enhance flavour game preparing defining demon negotiating binding dismissing rebinding need demon breed ability elementals beast lord discussion true name like included know extent thing differ stormbringer rule preliminary reading seem good job describing whole process way would playable atmospheric minor part rule invocation get much space prior two type magic least draft rule described much relation story time elric used invocation rather summoning described limit invocation indicated imprecise andecdotal way provide handy framework expect final rule contain system related detail like pow cost chance success still relatively small space succeeded making invocation seem different interesting like spell minor call upon creature manifest however ability tied invoked direct link tie established dangerous  enchantment given even le space draft basically thing powerful magic placed freeing user knowledge magic indicate enchanted item oneofakind thing special ability differs massproduction rule enchanting many game  let put another point armour fireblade   move burden onto gamemaster scenario writer also section rumored item described draft probably final manuscript although item might simply described general rather system detail well glean cursory glance magic rule described draft stress information draft mi interpreted purport know talking intention designer question certainly try find answer ask someone would know  final note even draft form impressed game trying create read stormbringer rule elric rule set lot closely tied story certain sort  mature  roleplaying le feel cheap mechanic draft might expected maybe function fairly terse presentation maybe indication overall feel game copout simply providing heap background system think avoid making system cheap excuse following tone book  maybe talking purple side brain liam routt darcsyde production           eric rowe rowe sodaberkeleyedu subject pendragon rule modification system pendragon pendragon rule change rd edition currently using game well reason made nt know changed th ed come hopefully also brief review upcoming magic system week two taking damage real rebated equal greater size mount roll required horsemanship dex whichever least basically seemed silly horsemanship affect ability stay horse effect passion reduced success giving  critical giving  applied trait skill player lived would end fairly high weapon skill loyalty lord often ran battle lord player would constantly succeed passion roll walk battle criticalling opponent every blow seemed bit extreme try passion success criticals roleplayed used bonus defense berserker attack case reduced bonus  reason reduced passion many crits fumble longer occur occur rolled followed another roll greater  skill use removed problem magic number wherein suddenly could never fail get shield also could never fumble second roll basically mean higher skill le chance fumble oppossed old system skill level effect chance fumble suddenly disappeared logic fall apart bit low skill level like never bothered u way problem party combat critical higher one applied normal success level disliked fact could critically succeed opponent even one better dead meat critical help defense well change optional lance rule rule use special joust like tournament regular battle combat wish remain horse may elect attack concentrate remaining mounted effect make damage needed force dex roll go equal size equal size time  automatic falling occurs size time chest aiming instead trying hit shield bump opponent trying seriously maim reduce skill win dice resolution get shield even succeeded skill head aiming really mean skilled reduce skill aim head dice resolution favor opponent get shield must make roll remain horsed damage le size damage equal greater size mean automatic falling lastly always allow voluntary reduction skill number dice used
