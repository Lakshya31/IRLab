introduction virtual reality computing move attention given subject user interface interest idea graphic user interface clearly indicates people looking way work machine direct intuitive past year seen rise number computer hardware software producer getting fray become known  multimedia  integration sound visuals largescale memory form optical cdrom drive lie around corner quantum leap thinking human computer interact fact nt around corner way already virtual reality term coined describe concept immersing user data rather looking screen typing using pointer device mouse trackball idea  creating world  personal computer entirely new reading file probably game two hard disk simulates world sort flight simulator perhaps maybe driving auto racing simulator space exploration combat game even something simple chess game give perspective  virtual  chessboard reading result compuserves graphic forum already obviously interest creating image create visual environment electronically whether interest geared toward realistic landscape raytracing abstract imagery created using fractal raytracing paint program image processor topic one take sort exploration move new level thoroughly immersed image moment reality final step take notion add dynamic animation move u four dimension height width depth time much work done right new computer discipline much work already done soon doubt work strictly domain military research university study private enterprise r program begin see light day already virtual reality system used thing like modeling molecular structure chemical research architectural modeling aerodynamics suprise flight training earliest commercial application virtual reality technology almost certainly emerge first two widely differing field game computer aided design work going university north carolina nasa autodesk mit medium lab many place including many company started sole purpose developing new field go section since computer art forum may already apparent personal computer evolve leap bound thing seemed like pure science fiction year ago concept personal computer first taking shape real form fractint available program allowing exploration world mathematics turned art also dkb raytracer developed david buck developing new version done collaboration among ci user much fractint continually developed possibility exists work similar type possible sort talent interest brought bear new field example c source code available interfacing mattel power glove ibmcompatible pc r port needed area hardware make world virtual reality accessible pc user example headmounted display using miniature display used pocketsize television set binocular configuration hardware available software needed anybody game design experience would helpful creating dynamic environment virtual reality interested animation may much offer principle involved fractal raytracing applied new field extent sort creative spirit collaborative effort present elsewhere graphic forum certainly make progress anything make progress area welcome nt ability make technical contribution may able offer great deal anyway new territory always need imagination vision sense direction purpose new technology suggestion fire message somebody may ability mean make may seem outlandish surface reality idea extensive fit short message mean crank word processor write upload fairly new stuff thing wide open virtual reality truly new frontier computing hype aside change face computing profoundly key word may seem era vlsi chip technology multinational electronics corporation impossible basement experimenter hobbyist make advance computer sense may true however worth noting personal computer grew effort sort people roughly year ago also significant many reading amateur hobbyist computer professional may one best place possible begin movement virtual reality system domain truly personal computing something available without massive financial technical resource disposal certainly result possible mhz dosbased machine equal potential cray nt mean work nt begin level however worth reflecting altair minicomputer made available kit form mid  unimaginably crude weak today standard fired imagination thousand may well one people one people inspired would regarded today ugly paperweight went considerably advanced realm computer industry today largely built effort people realized full ramification model computer today virtual reality stand beach kitty hawk nt take much extrapolate possible future given advancement technology future economics computer hardware shop project pair bicycle mechanic eventually became f learjet altair eventually led thing like based machine x display capable color video board like targa macintosh iici next sun workstation work done level major effect course development vr mention fact could great fun electronics today much thought need given idea standard evolve determines form medium take influenced heavily thought action people interested using technology thing nt simply handed ivory tower corporation work done public forum may well effect future shape virtual reality homeuser level fact lot  major player  getting involved already involved vr work different level technology lot focus vr work devoted thing like new way access huge amount data business government also whole new world explored term application individual pc lot think entering world  cyberspace  hardware software problem philisophical question well use exactly much reality human perception question ahead big one without doubt broad address like asking  computer used  major stuff question large main purpose develop hardware software used average dosbased machine course work doubt much discussion purpose important try keep balance keep project going hope hopefully point interest activity justify moving new forum devoted entirely vr different section devoted hardware software project file well social philisophical issue depends active section much interest draw jump right know people frequent forum may interested informative encourage stop start thing need dialog hope get thing going soon start working bring virtual reality average computer john eagan
