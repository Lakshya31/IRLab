header intact correction welcomed                                         everybody probably already know research machine sell claim computer nimbus charge double price anybody else charge give school traditional discount looking back pcw issue found review suggested nimbus nimbus nimbus long u msnet best computer school could buy supposed faster powerful processor network found reliable fastest may better others time performance still leaf lot desired anyway enough prattle hacking network simplest quickest way get root directory course get fileserver terminate server program type user password file ctrlaltdel restart server far know two release network software file structure organised slightly differently start release logon screen light blue colour limited offer offer resource eg printer floppy drive fixed disk offer defined file server either bootup network running syntax share resource name path name password rwcd resource name arbitrary name offer think character long path name something like  c foobar   prn  one switch begin  password r ead access w rite access c hange access elete independent must occur order access given resource anything connected resource anything apart select deselect example resource without access drive change drive even change directory ca nt directory file disk usually read write access given resource important offer given read access example standard setup normal user given read access drive p public readwritechange access drive n way given read write change ca nt delete file although save file also would normally given write access printer resource name release usually user name example two common resource share might share userc user pw rwc share publicc public pw rwc far nt mentioned password field user allocated resource etc password field optional character field mean people little utility called use ca nt get later resource totally separate user held file called offer release held root directory server bootup floppy user information password access etc held file called user net somewhere winchester generated userstxt contains ascii format password access userstxt essential redundant release usersnet typeable try ascii dump ignoring control character debugcom good see somewhere list user name password file also contains detail resource allocated user contain resource name password another way get resource name password watch server screen boot ca nt understand happening usersnet system mail installed try typing file user mail contains mail password default login one using user information easy  type user name password login screen user watch netmgr access whole hard disk  succeed cracking user try drive k l n default password secret sometimes changed way bit elementary get caught easily someone type status file server user name machine number displayed screen manage obtain resource name password use somewhere network find little utility called useexe may public drive server bootup floppy file netexe nethlp usehlp setnamecom may use well anyway syntax connect use device name netnameresourcename password disconnect use device name alternatively reuseexe well syntax reuse device name netnameresourcename password use dis connects resource reuse connects different resource field command share command apart netname command try typing set logged somewhere may line saying server net name usually server server rather sketchy report since nt time explain everything another idea monitor data sent across network directly using subbios call use bbc basic rm basic subbios extension package make detail call look advanced reference manual manage get use working first type setname setname dot mean nobody notice using root directory resource release slightly different dark blue screen standard system message booting welcome standard network release something sort also space bottom network manager place message release interesting file kept network mgr hard disk file mgr automatically copied network bootup network file one operation mgr file one used next bootup make modification file mgr directory change wo nt immediately noticed interesting file change sysmesstxt executable file mgr directory notable netman careful using best thing copy file mgr ram drive run netman ramdrive copy netgobat usersnet back mgr get sharing violation error one person try run netman directly check first add line beginning file netgobat saying netst create batch file copy usersnet public drive innocuous name able find anybody password time whatever nt delete important file somebody else work hooliganism absolutely pointless like virus going round anybody know enough want easily stop  innocent user nt know going get caught might idea little suggestion sysmesstxt security improved                                         downloaded p system
