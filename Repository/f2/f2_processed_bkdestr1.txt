 jack ripper present book destruction part written conceived brought jack ripper   prelude  part one ongoing series reading file basic understanding explosive also know make tnt nitroglycerin black powder dynamite safely home   disclaimer  way responsible act end user also responsible way accident damage one person file protected constitutional right right freedom speech advocate file also protected right bear arm pump as full buckshot fuck  formality let get good stuff first let actually find definition explosive explosive substance device capable producing volume rapidly expanding gas exerts sudden pressure surroundings basically two type explosive detonating high explosive deflagrating low explosive difference detonating explosive like tnt dynamite characterized rapid decomposition high pressure wheras deflagrating explosive lik black powder merely burn rapidly create low pressure however know black powder certain condition detonate example pack enclosed area pipe co cannister detonating explosive divided two type primary secondary primary explosive detonate ignition ie flame spark impact mean heat secondary explosive require detonator occassionally secondary booster basic remembered marked term come back haunt  b l c k p w e r  gunpowder blackpowder call likely invented chinese around th century blackpowder burn best fine fineness measured f f etc finest though f least finest f teach make excellent quality gunpowder short factory fa po best material needed         shaker drink mixer morter pestle sulphur potassium nitrate charcoal preferably matchlite old charcoal graphite ratio    potassium nitrate charcoal sulphur  graphite half pencil worth glazing note ratio vary suplhur slow burning process potassium nitrate speed experiment find ratio work best grind charcoal sulphur together fine dust also note explode also sometimes best put charcoal brickets plastic bag smash brick heavy object next grind salt peter potassium nitrate two chemical also note powder must consistancy first powder optimum result pour sulphur charcoal mixture pour salt peter add small amount graphite crushed finely put shaker shake vigorously minute note longer shaked better quality adding graphite process called glazing done graphite form small film gunpowder also round corner powder also newly glazed gunpowder moisture resistant flow poured easily nt stick much ignition     black powder relatively insensitive shock friction need flame heat ignited ignited lighter red hot iron flame sort fuse touch iron favorite keep distace powder  n r g l c e r n  inventor likely unknown likely blew bit nevertheless ascanio sobrero credited finding alfred nobel worked extensively sold american holding nitro  obviously screwed good hard american know explosion occurs             chono  n co chono  ignition  h  nitro explodes chemistry major notice biproducts nitrogen water carbon dioxide material     material listed one quite dangerous want everyone read time attempting anything procedure     mix part fuming nitric acid note specific gravity degree baume best result part sulphuric acid nitric acid poured sulphuric acid way around splatter hot let cool cool add part glycerine slowly possible glycerine allowed trickle side container nt drip straight container note glycerin added fast stuff ignite eligible wheelchair olympics next stir glass rod second carefully pour time volume water visibly precipitate immediatly twice much nitro used glycerin easy separate next mix baking soda immidiatly separated keep going spontaneously special note part weight baume scale specific gravity found chemistry book get fuming nitric sulphuric acid chemical supply warehouse fertilizer store nt make gram time ever always wear sort body eye protection glycerin obtained pharmacy medical supply co also washed baking soda stable abrupt bump sharp movement take hand also note nitroglycerin much safer handle frozen freeze degree farenheit degree celcius therefore easily frozen ice ignition     well one easy drop throw something also please remember loud fart could set stuff please please careful  n e  invented alfred nobel first easiest form make dynamite nitroglycerin guhr guhr kieselguhr silicous porous earth used absorbed large quantity nitroglycerin longer used guhr draw power explosion term  dope  applied inert ingridients dynamite straight dynamite would dope get better dope dynamite wood pulp sodium nitrate oxidizer straight dynamite ratio work excellently explosive material     nitrolglycerin wood pulp procedure     simpler thought well mix percent wood pulp nitroglycerin done mixture done care let wood pulp absorb nitroglycerin note many variation formula cotton would work place wood pulp etc  almost anything absorb nitro work best experiment industrial dynamite             ammonium nitrate sodium chloride tnt powdered bark scale follow making modern dynamite ratio commonly used industry around found safer use ammonium nitrate place nitro obvious reason formula made dry powdered form gelatin synthesis pretty much requires lab anyone access lab leave mail help problem might also note tnt trinitrotoluene ratio formula weight look like gunpowder experiment variate also making formula follow procedure gunpowder except graphite  n r r n r l u e n e  tnt widespread weapon used shell grenade horde mixture commonly mixed rdx explosive device torpedo cyclotol used shattering explosive power  pound per square inch many us however aquired plan figure schematic rdx one kept public obvious reason along c family ie c c c etc  c popular tnt great melted safely poured future container later use well procedure also note melting point tnt degree farenheit material     would much rather read dangerous difficult make twenty seven time made worked twelve time also done step step much difficult nitro dynamite procedure     take two beaker beaker prepare solution sulfuric acid nitric acid water beaker b prepare solution nitric acid sulfuric acid ten gram beaker poured beaker c placed ice bath add ten gram toluene beaker c stir several minute remove beaker c ice bath gently heat reach degree celcius stir constantly heated fifty additional gram solution beaker added beaker c temperature allowed rise degree celcius held degree celcius ten minute note oily liquid begin form top acid solution minute acid solution returned ice bath cooled degree celcius reaching temp oily liquid sink bottom collect use syringe draw remaining acid solution fifty gram beaker added oily liquid temp slowly raised degree celcius temp reached kept degree celcius minute solution allowed cool degree celcius kept degree minute drain acid saving oily liquid next gram sulfuric acid added oily liquid heated degree celcius reach degree add gram beaker b temp raised degree degree held degree hour hour solution lowered degree held minute time oil removed acid washed boiling water washing boiling water start stir consistantly watch tnt begin solidify start solidify cold water add beaker tnt form pellet done quite long trying expierience note weight temperature time specific nt blow wont work also acid solution nitroglycerin dissolve flesh second careful god sake also tnt melted container future use well deserving enemy violent mixture next tnt see already used make dynamite want something little kick plain tnt dynamite amatol    mixture ammonium nitrate tnt used government better killer must good amatol made easily melted tnt poured container ratio    ammonium nitrate tnt ammonium nitrate tnt military value mixture used mainly wwi world war moron used artilley shell aerial bomb composition pretty much good sort devastating projectile per say neighbor house car ohh well look like end book destruction part take easy nt blow see book destruction part ii intermidiate later  jack ripper please note rash jack ripper please dont confuse jack ripper found fone conspiracy phrozen phorest
