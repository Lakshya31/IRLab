start learning email send message publicaccess site actually several different type mail system let send receive mail start simplest one known appropriately enough  mail  look couple interface host system command prompt type mail username username name gave first logged hit enter computer might respond subject type test actually anything hit enter get end screen hit enter cursor drop line begin writing actual message type sentence anything hit first unix frustration one bug repeatedly hit enter get end line like typewriter many unix program wordwrapping although way get unix text processor emacs wordwrap done message hit return hit controld control key time unix command tell computer done writing close  envelope  mail could also hit enter blank line type period beginning line hit enter sent first email message sending mail rather someone somewhere else net message already arrived see moment wanted could even written message computer uploaded electronic  envelope  couple good reason long involved message one hit enter end line  mail  ca nt readily fix mistake line unless use special command call unix text processor also paying access hour uploading prepared message save money remember save document ascii text format uploading document created word processor us special formatting command day mean many program cause strange effect get blank line subject line upload message using ascii protocol copy paste text software allows done hit controld mail waiting normally log publicaccess site tell whether new mail waiting open mailbox see waiting mail type mail hit enter host

telecommunication software logging textbuffer function start hit number message want see computer ask want call file create name file hit enter type number message want see hit enter message finish scrolling turn textbuffer function message saved computer way read message connected net save money paying hour write reply offline meantime respond message delete save respond type lowercase  r  hit enter get something like adamg subject test note time nt enter username computer take message replying automatically address message sender computer also automatically insert subject line adding

copy usenet posting file example use unix command ever want anything file like msdos unix operating system tell computer thing unix may reputation even complex msdos case basic simple command ever need computer us msdos pcdos basic concept seem familiar  watch cd command work differently enough similarly named do command drive crazy also unlike msdos unix case sensitive  type command directory name wrong case get error message used working mac remember unix store file  directory  rather  folder  unix directory organized like branch tree bottom  root  directory subdirectory branching subdirectory turn subdirectory mac equivalent unix subdirectory folder within another folder cat equivalent msdos  type  command pause file every screen type cat file  file  name file want see hitting controlc stop display alternately could type file achieve result also use cat writing uploading text file name home directory similar msdos  copy con  command type cat test start file called  test  either write something simple editing finished line hit return end line upload something file using communication software ascii protocol close file hit controld cd  change directory  command change present directory another type cd directory hit enter unlike msdos us denote sub directory example stufftext unix us example stufftext change present directory stufftext subdirectory would type cd stufftext hit enter msdos need first backslash subdirectory come directory already move back directory tree would type cd  followed enter note space cd two period  msdos user really go nut cp copy file syntax cp file file would copy file file overwrite file file l command followed enter tell directory similar do dir command except alphabetical order l stop listing every line  handy lot thing directory basic l command list  hidden  file login file control system interacts unix see file type l l l l tell size file byte tell created modified mv similar msdos rename command mv file file rename file file command also used move file directory mv file news would move file news directory rm deletes file type rm filename hit enter beware hit enter gone good wildcards searching copying deleting file use  wildcards  sure file exact name l man would find following file manual manualtxt manoman use question mark sure one two character example l man would find file called mane one called manual  thing go wrong send message get back ominous looking message mailerdaemon containing several dozen line computerese followed message somewhere line often find clue went wrong might made mistake spelling email address site sending mail might maintenance problem may used wrong  translation  mail noninternet network call host system text editor write message reply one ca nt seem get emacs try controlx controlc word hit control key x key time followed control c worse come worse hang elm accidentally hit key message want save type number message hit enter u  undelete  message work exit elm quit message gone try upload ascii message written computer message preparing elm pine get lot left bracket capital m k l funnylooking character believe message actually wind looking fine garbage temporary reflects problem unix text processor ascii uploads take much longer upload finish one way deal call simple mail program produce weird character upload text file message another way better prepared message response somebody mail create text file host system cat example cat file upload text elm pine insert message simple command controlr pine example time wo nt see extraneous stuff nt cleared elm mailbox awhile accidentally hit   meant hit  n  viceversa exiting message disappeared look news directory command line type cd news file called recieved message unfortunately way
