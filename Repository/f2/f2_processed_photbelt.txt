exactly lot thing orbit ought easy use book history space flight pick satellite channelers refer particularly since early satellite couldnt lot science truly care mr nanomius able find enlighten u speaking astronomer however would nt trust measurement made  would demand redone least people challenging theory say light year distance pleiades earth great would take superluminal velocity orbit solar system circle period claimed indeed case channelings claim measurement astronomical light distance skewed due lack proper accounting new technique going devised let math said distance pleiades

possible according relativity assure mr nanomius would notice see question please contact privately larger question would orbiting pleiades would require large mass centered derive mass fact velocity

become great suggested either gross error made either greek halley since halley confident accuracy measurement greek concluded pleiades motion p book halley refer observation recorded say mainstream astronomer familiar observation observation pleiadian motion later proved frederick wilhelm bessel discovered motion  second arc per century star pleiadian cluster p question recorded research say mainstream astronomer think sorry say almost insulting halley discovered proper motion bessel made later observation absolutely reputable astronomer would ever contend proper motion doesnt exist recorded course think believe mr nanomious claim whit mr nanomius also seems laboring false assumption work astronomy least done ca nt tell halley bessel might written find would consult rare book section good library never read original text th th century would pointless astronomical discovery pas accepted body thought appear first review textbook catalog real sense care either halley bessel measured proper motion pleiades done many time since ever better equipment want use certain value paul otto hesse also studied pleiades discovered right angle degree movement star pleiades photon belt shaped like torroid thickness approximately  solar year  billion mile since hesse bessel correct earth completing  year cycle within photon belt p question paul otto hesse book say observe call photon
