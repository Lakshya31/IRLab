pc memory management overview do user faced confusing array memory configuration today conventional memory upper memory expanded memory extended memory high memory area name plus acronym like umb upper memory block em expanded memory specification xms extended memory specification hma high memory area vcpi virtual control program interface dpmi do protected mode interface confuse matter even document try explain pc memory architecture well popular memory management technique standard reason different type memory evolution intel x family microprocessor year since microprocessor used original ibm pc  xtclass  machine seen tremendous growth speed capability pc microprocessor yet limitation original design still hold u back primary limitation ability processor address mb range memory  seemed like lot time kb extent addressing capability competing nonintel microprocessor ibm designed original pc reserved upper kb mb pc bios basic inputoutput system video memory adapter board install additional ram allowing application write directly added ram order communicate adapter left u kb do application program microprocessor support full mb address space however additional memory accessible operates termed protected mode default mode operation real mode compatible real mode little fast time designed intel idea pc would enjoy widespread popularity hence design protected mode incompatible real mode intel anticipated since protected mode offered many advantage real mode real mode would  go away  processor instruction put processor protected mode way return application like nondedicated netware x o vx various do extenders play real feat magic order switch real protected mode mostly switch protected mode back real mode done performing hard reset microprocessor ctrlaltdel like processor reset command sent keyboard controller response back keyboard controller wake processor back reset real mode reason people often report sluggish keyboard problem nondedicated netware keyboard controller designed support operation added exciting new feature addition supporting real mode protected mode support even mb gb physical memory tb virtual memory thanks flat bit address space physical memory accessible one flat address space programmer often hampered kb time addressing limit one real exciting enhancement virtual mode hardware feature able emulate multiple microprocessor desqview window enhanced mode o v perform magic multi tasking do application varying degree success also support memory paging hardware application see logical view memory application make memory request processor redirects access actual physical location also provided limited subset memory paging support protected mode paging per kb segment basis page kb boundary make available virtual mode well memory management product like qemm tothemax msdos drdos emm perform memory management magic do application since talking microprocessor background ill also mention effectively highly tuned highlyoptimized nt add many new capability mostly faster execution past design family also includes integrated math coprocessor need really speed number crunching sx essentially crippled without builtin math coprocessor sake completeness also mention sx sx software compatible except external access make outside world made bit time instead bit make tad slower full blown come accessing memory device similarly compatible processor except make external access bit time instead bit time type design make system little slower allows lower priced component used building system making enhanced processor capability available machine lower price point history intel family processor mind let move different type memory conventional memory memory range kb directly accessible do

qemm tothemax several popular do extenders designed allow application running protected mode access do bios service do real mode operating system requires extension allow protected mode application
