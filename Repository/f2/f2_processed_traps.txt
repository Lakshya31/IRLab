booby trap      road trap incorporates wiretrip action complete electrical circuit extremely simple make since equipment gathered around house great advantage particular device explosive detonated vehicle directly insuring maximum destruction construct road trap begin digging three hole across roadway two hole place explosive charge third place regular car battery connect first wire negative

metal contact point touch complete electrical circuit thus causing detonation explosive charge loose floorboard trap one utilizes principle book trap relies two metal contact point touching complete electrical circuit beneath loose floorboard two strip pliable metal bamboo metal contact point touch pressure brought loose floorboard gate trap extremely simple effective relatively safe booby trap cock booby trap pull pin regular tension release grenade place beneath swining gate anywhere supply pressure necessary gate moved either opened closed pressure released grenade detonated chimney trap take three four stick dynamite tape together attach nonelectrical blasting cap three four foot fuse tape dynamite five foot inside chimney leaving fuse hanging loose downward end fuse foot chimney sight fire lit heat generated ignite fuse explode charge chimney work extremely well since tamping supplied structure chimney car trap many advantage important carry power supply rather use ignition system car wire run electrical blasting cap point along electrical ignititon system attached alligator clip key turned complete ignition system thus explode bomb good place hide explosive hollow
