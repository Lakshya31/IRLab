softlauntxt additional instruction soft drink launcher file intended accompany file softlaungif graphically detail device described herein overview  short  mortar  constructed express purpose launching soft drink can straight air crude prone rupture use consumes rather inordinate amount pyrodex sure fun make incredible amount noise go construction material  large coffee empty lid concrete mix admixture water etc driveway repair mix okay steel reinforcing wire full soft drink noncarbonated possible paper thin flexible plastic sheeting tape vaseline drill drill bit fit fuze wire construction procedure  tape either paper plastic around soft drink enclosing bottom smoothly consistently possible try avoid kind seam make fairly tight fit whatever size intend launch wrappedup used form inside barrel refer barrel mandrel diameter important can slightly different diameter make sure choose one similar type can intend launch wrapping may leave top part open bottom must sealed smoothly smoothly wrapped full soft drink paper plastic coat side smooth thin layer vaseline ensure easy removal concrete set construct basket steel wire basket sit inside coffee encased concrete providing tensile reinforcement concrete strong compressive us tensile use addition reinforcing basket greatly extend life maximum load mortar unsure close space wire basket experiment ask someone experience reinforcing concrete rule thumb reinforcing wire stronger point would recommend mesh closer   optimally would recommend spacing wire  one inch apart inner portion basket must large enough handle displacement soft drink barrel test putting reinforcing basket coffee holding barrel mandrel approximately go adjust shape reinforcing basket accommodate barrel mandrel sure shape reinforcing basket tape place inside coffee hold place concrete poured mix concrete directed stronger concrete better still probably going end blowing amount use better err side little extra moisture concrete mixture aid removal air bubble pour concrete coffee allowing flow smoothly around reinforcing basket fill coffee yet close full press barrel mandrel wet concrete right center seat mandrel required depth barrel length add concrete mix might need fill coffee completely everything poured mandrel straight true vertical shake even banging hard surface non carbonated soda come handy rapping side hand try settle concrete remove air bubble might weaken structure concrete completely set anywhere week carefully pull barrel mandrel inspect work may help rotate mandrel withdraw concrete perfectlyshaped shallow mortar made reinforced concrete wish may wipe vaseline barrel necessary remove vaseline burn within launch using mortar important allow concrete fully set depending brand concrete could require full month nt jump gun pun intended incompletely set concrete far weaker easily explode launch concrete fully set use drill bit drill flash hole measure barrel  depth  carefully drill straight side right bottom part combustion chamber choose drill bit approximately diameter fuzewire intend use drill carefully make sure go straight drill press drill jig may helpful drill accurately launch material  pyrodex green hobby fuze soft drink type loadfiller match lighter launch procedure  carefully review safety note contained bottom document attempt launch choose area soft grass dirt place mortar best place hard surface since nothing absorb launch shock greatly reduce useful life mortar must place hard surface place stack old newspaper telephone book help cushion launch shock keen feature device launching content soda starting may want launch empty aluminum lightweight good first test mortarbuilding skill later may want add water sand increase weight therefore ultimate range selected filled projectile slip barrel ensure good fit slightly loose fine le th inch diameter make sure bind stick firmly way seat bottom barrel satisfied smooth operation projectile within barrel remove projectile barrel insert length fuze fuze hole pushing remains burned fuze previous launch make sure significant length fuze reach combustion chamber ensure positive ignition fire safety put small piece tape fuze right enters side add small amount pyrodex r powder launch tube say  start small  good amount teaspoon le always work mortar holding together well powder pile bottom barrel touching fuze wire enough ensure positive ignition without placing projectile barrel yet position mortar launching site recommend keeping nearly vertical least tipped degree vertical mortar fall one side launch damage mortar fall fuze burn telling projectile going go sideways ready launch slip projectile barrel testing make sure nt bind scrape badly way light fuze go run really really far away hide behind large solid object boulder great place hide behind make sure projectile nt come head afterwards reuse mortar remove unburnt partially burnt fuze andor gunpowder make sure ember remain usually necessary clean mortar launch unless enough grease build becomes difficult insert fuze load powder reuse carefully inspect mortar looking particularly concrete sign structural failure crack chip bulge etc mortar becomes cracked throw away continue using cracked mortar next time likely explode theory operation  ignition gunpowder generate gas pressure inside combustion chamber hopefully weak link soft drink go skyrocketing mortar load much powder weight may rupture mortar brings load note load note  powder put mortar total expanded gas might generated ignition say  might  choose light projectile empty soda leave barrel long powder burned fully thereby relieving pressure mortar conversely choose heavy projectile left time powder fully burn depending amount powder gas generated could exceed structural strength mortar remember every time make projectile heavier mean powder burn press bit harder projectile get move also mean projectile tend stay barrel longer allowing powder burn pressure generating higher higher chamber pressure handloaders black powder enthusiast know tiny increase projectile weight powder load result drastic increase chamber pressure rapidly lead structural failure make much pressure inside mortar structurally fail explode like grenade lighter load extend useful life mortar heavy load stress concrete cause crack earlier sure fun safety note  device kill attempt without careful supervision someone experience constructing explosive device attempt without proper eye hearing hand protection case accidental detonation mortar rupture smoke operating device accidental detonation may occur projectile leaf barrel mouth fairly impressive blast wave emanating device sure wear hearing protection coffee around concrete may aid capture retention concrete shrapnel mortar fail nt count big piece highspeed concrete quickly ruin day always fun please report success failure improvement etc address kwd netcomcom may find update project
