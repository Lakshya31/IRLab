differentiation epithelial tissue since high dos vitamin employed treatment severe acne various disorder keratinization vitamin use however limited side effect liver toxicity pseudotumor cerebri particular attempt find drug better therapeutic index vitamin several synthetic retinoids developed one isotretinoin cisretinoic acid first synthesized largely ignored result first major clinical trial demonstrating efficacy treatment severe recalcitrant cystic acne published isotretinoin approved united state single indication trade name accutane major feature drug produce prolonged remission patient severe cystic acne many responded therapy striking discovery however remission often sustained month year four fivemonth treatment course completed transport metabolism vitamin retinol isotretinoin significant difference vitamin isotretinoin regard transport metabolism account difference toxicity major source vitamin retinol conversion dietary plant carotenoid intestinal mucosa retinol stored liver contains body store mobilization liver accomplished retinol bound specific transport protein retinol binding protein delivers tissue plasma level vitamin tend remain constant despite wide variation diet extremely high dietary intake eg polar bear liver vitamin tablet produce hypervitaminosis hypervitaminosis result greatly increased hepatic store subsequent toxicity contrast isotretinoin bind serum albumin isotretinoin readily absorbed orally put circulation via portal system significantly stored organ system plasma level vary amount ingested mode action isotretinoin treatment acne acne disease pilosebaceous unit pathogenesis acne believed include several factor among excessive sebum production abnormal keratinization follicular epithelium proliferation propionibacterium acne inflammation hormonal regulation sebaceous gland isotreinoin affect several mechanism exact mode action known isotretinoin cause pronounced temporary inhibition sebum production atrophy sebaceous gland general two week standard therapy mgkgday sebum production decreased end four five month treatment period reduced greater patient continue decreased sebum production month year cessation therapy sebum production vast majority return baseline level within month since sebum production return normal patient obviously sole mechanism prolonged remission acne seen individual many patient continue improve even therapy discontinued investigator believe isotretinoin inhibits follicular keratinization patient acne postulate prevents formation comedomes whitehead blackhead precursor inflammatory acne lesion isotretinoin decrease quantity propionbacterium acne treated patient organism normal flora within follicle increased number bacteria patient acne produce various chemotactic factor enzyme may increase inflammation decreased number bacteria isotretinointreated patient thought result decreased sebum production producing poor environment proliferation organism therefore decreased bacterial count thought secondary primary mechanism action accutane clinical side effect mucocutaneous side effect common seen isotretinoin treatment people treated experience cheilitis usually within first two week treatment easily treated bland emolliation generalized xerosis common frequently acne patient view beneficial rather adverse effect xerosis become problematic use noncomedogenic emollient lotion employed frequently patient develop nose bleeds noninfectious conjunctivitis symptomatic treatment problem indicated le patient notice temporary
