charging battery reading message  battery help  thought might able clear popular misconception battery many problem blamed memory shorted cell often problem resulting improper charging dischargingit grey area clearcut answer hard find soon find one question often asked nicad  deep discharged condition cell  here grey area start manufacturer suggest form deep discharge occasionally never total discharge device ielaptops camcorder internal circuitry sense battery discharged near rated capacity disconnect either partially totally load nt drop load resistor across terminal kill cause cell damage one extent another importantly begin charging shortly completed discharge adress lead acid battery later file mean dont deep discharge lead acid cell definetly harm possibly destroy itagain charging shortly discharge essential long cycle life lead acid battery well nicad charger exist many formsthey simple transformer cap diode complicated microprossesor based system cost extravigant better result usually problem terminate charge overcharging cell result ventingthis cell build pressure internally result overcharging release elecrolite airover time cause cell damage resulting significant decrease cycle life time battery discharge subsequently recharges full capacity following graph show voltage profile single nicad cell charge cycle l x l x l x l x x l x l l voltage x l l x l l x l l x l l x l l x capacity l approx notice voltage peak near full capacity start drop simple assumption would tell could sense peak drop commonly referred negative delta v terminate charge right   wrong promblem occurs put cell series battery get appropriate voltagesthey slightly different voltage profile charge cycle like l xcell l l l ocell l l l tcell l xt x l l x x l oxt x lvoltage xot l xot l xot l xot l xot l l l xot l l l xot capacity l l lll l l see thing get kinda grey graph unrealistic sense impossible determine individual cell voltage connected series form battery actually happens get mushy curveif terminate early position see graph cell full capacity terminate overcharge number method charge termination simpler others effective others popular one temperature cell accepts current certain effeciency wich turn incoming energy stored chemical energy cell efficiency cell system optimized year point efficientwere come play simple energy energy outif cell reached full capacity incoming energy charging system go somwhere somwhere heat sense increase temperature terminate chargesounds simple numerous drawbacksfirst temprature sensing device close proximity cell impracticle case secondly problem cell different eachother may terminate early maybe late guess good mine lastly battery located near charging system near transformer transitors diode heat generating device compensate negative delta v discussed many drawback popular among higher grade system coulometric control basically coulometer keep track much energy get discharged put back high cost inaccuracy mesuring equipment keep one ultra high grade market constant voltage nt even think every manufacturer strongly suggest anything constant current popular requires alot guess work part manufactureryou select charge current appropriate capacity cellsto high overcharge low take  hour reach full capacity combination also common exept conv result nice system far told everything wrong nicad charger truthfull many work okmost manufacturer claim nicad cycle  time treated properly problem treated properly mean making many compromise unrealistic impossible applicationsthe last form charging like discus algorithm  pulse  chargingit employ alot method listed twist basic pulse charge algorithm look somthing like l           second             l  next cycle   l l l l xxxxxxx   charge level  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x x charge level             x xxxxxxxx         x x x x xxxxx       discharge start constant current charger output determined capacity cellscharge level one represents current passed battery specified levellets say level amp charge level  amp period time let say m putting current battery charge level time expires go part two  discharge point short period time say m discharge  time level charged case amp serf one major function  burping  nicad cell charging one gas generated internaly oxygen form sits two plate batterythe problem happens crystal begin form cell use bubble bridge two plate anode cathode cell complete bridge dialectric short dead battery happens m pulse  burp  save alot trouble break bubble allows oxygen readily available continuing chemical reactionthis accomplishes couple thing result oxygen situation mentioned charge much higher level without cell venting fast charge secondly prevent short giving longer cycle lifejust note interest crystal form cell shorting cause chemical conversion take place charging discharging slow somtimes point cell ca nt function anymoretrue  memory  yet proved really happening battery quits best way prevent keep battery charged use getting back pulse charging last segment algorithm called quiet windowit serf two basic purpose allows cell chemically recuperate discharging provides period time collect information cell looking delta v quiet window loop begin charge level run continuosly second interval terminated method charge termination cell reach near full capacity type maintanance charge usually applied running algorithym lower frequency amplitude help top cell keep fully charged technology fairly new introduced various consumer market soonmy advice people stuck cheap nicad charger supplied manufacturer selective next time spending extra purchase time pay one battery last year opposed cycle comment question send reply glenn sahlin
