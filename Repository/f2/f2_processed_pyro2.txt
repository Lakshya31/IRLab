pyrotxt touch paper self igniting mixture percussion explosive part series file pyrotechnic explosive serious stuff really dangerous nt treat seriously kid watch many cartoon remember part body get blown away real world stay blown away ca nt treat stuff respect nt screw around file start set safety rule nt skip read em memorize em beginning set general rule always apply thing know material using making time read thoroughly starting anything pyrotechnic preparation explosive nature unstable subject ignition explosion heat shock friction clear understanding dangerous property due care handling ingredient finished product necessary accident avoided always observe possible precaution particularly following mix small batch one time mean gram ounce nt go big mix  make bigger accident power explosive cube every ounce ounce time powerful one ounce weighing chemical use clean piece paper scale pan item discard used paper bucket water weighing next ingredient safe worker dispose chemical spilled workbench equipment weighing nt keep open container chemical table since accidental spillage mixing may occur finished container close replace storage shelf use clean equipment chemical ground grind separately never together thoroughly wash clean equipment grinding another ingredient mixing batch done outdoors away flammable structure building barn garage etc mix also made non metallic container avoid spark glass also used since shatter case accident handy small container made cutting top plastic bottle three four inch bottom mix may conveniently made placing ingredient plastic bottle rolling around mixture uniform case point open end container away never hold body face container stirring done wooden paddle stick avoid spark static powdered ground material may also mixed placing large sheet paper flat surface rolling across sheet lifting side corner one time never ram tamp mix paper cardboard tube pour material gently tap shake tube settle content store ingredient finished mix fire hazard away heat flame finished preparation may stored plastic bottle shatter case accident since many ingredient mix poisonous stored reach child pet preferably locked away sure thread screw top container cap thoroughly cleaned applies also container stopper rubber cork type closure trace mixture caught container closure may ignited friction opening closing container throughout procedure work clean condition always wear face shield least shatterproof safety glass careful worker handling dangerous material sure lens frame flammable always wear dust respirator handling chemical dust form small particle gather lung stay may cause serious illness later life always wear glove working chemical always wear waterproof lab apron must work indoors good ventilation system never smoke anywhere near working make sure open flame present motor produce spark inside hot water heater furnace pilot light stove spark known readily explode dust floating air always work someone two head better one source water readily available fire extinguisher hose etc never circumstance use metal load chemical put chemical firework metal casing worse handle live hand grenade never use metal container includes dangerous co cartridge many people killed flying fragment metal casing please use metal circumstance always thoroughly familiar chemical using information included file look whatever extra information material thought safe later found dangerous stuff wash hand face thoroughly using chemical nt forget wash ear nose device built fails work leave alone half hour may try bury never try unload reuse dud dust particle start form air stop leave settle read entire file trying anything never strike mixture containing chlorate nitrate perchlorate permanganate bichromate powdered metal nt drop even handle roughly rule may look like lot silly nonsense let look one example move  wizard oz  made actress played good witch severely burned one exploding special effect got hand actress played bad witch got really messed green coloring used face original actor played tin man got lung destroyed aluminum dust used color face actor know tin man actually replacement point chemical used direction people lot knowlegable chemical terrible accident still happened nt take stuff lightly using many chemical time quite dangerous please read following information carefully sodium azide nan white powder poisonous also bit unstable treat gently lead nitrate pb contains poisonous lead water soluble body absorb quickly given chance government banned leaded paint phasing leaded gasoline stuff slowly accumulates body screw sort important innards careless lead nitrate lifetime worth damage one afternoon ammonium nitrate nh commonly used fertilizer stuff somewhat dangerous large quantity particularly get hot entire shipload material known go heated gently decomposes water nitrous oxide laughing gas farmer sometimes use blow tree stump mixing fuel oil setting gunk detonator different use potassium nitrate kno also known saltpeter commercially used diuretic animal also work oxidizing agent various pyrotechnic mixture heated provides oxygen needed make rest mixture burn potassium potassium nitrate nitrite oxygen kno  kno potassium chlorate kclo much spectacular oxidizing agent potassium nitrate yield oxygen potassium nitrate easily pyrotechnic mixture containing chemical require much le yet burn fiercely even percussion readily set mixture useful sometimes make mixture sensitive like mixture containing chemical must handled carefully potassium chlorate also poisonous potassium potassium chlorate chloride oxygen kclo  kcl aluminum dust finely divided aluminum put glass jar almost look like solid piece grey metal form flammable also seriously damage lung inhale careful stir cloud dust go without saying nt use near open flame zinc dust finely divided zinc quite flammable aluminum dust still worth handling carefully also damage lung inhaled lampblack finely divided carbon usually obtained soot manufacturing process much effective pyrotechnic mixture powdered charcoal tiny spot almost unnoticeable stick hand smear incredibly far tidy expect find black smear face hand using sulfur yellow powder used reducing agent many pyrotechnic mixture buy finely powdered form also get hard lump waste extra time grind potassium permanganate oxidizing agent somewhat le vigorous others mentioned usually used pyrotechnic mixture expensive le effective alternative case right thing nt let accidentally come contact glycerine accident happens resulting mess immediately wiped wet paper towel buried flushed toilet thrown away dry waste receptacle gum arabic white powder mixed water make glue like substance useful coating various mixture binding together solid mass sodium peroxide strange dangerous oxidizer nt let get wet nt let touch skin glycerine thick liquid chemically similar rubbing alcohol though harder get burning burn right circumstance fairly safe stuff iodine crystal pure iodine steel grey solid poisonous produses poisonous vapor heated smell similar chlorine used bleach swimming pool accidentally drop hot surface notice odor leave area touch paper easily made material act like slow burning fuse ideal testing small amount pyrotechnic mixture made soaking piece absorbent paper like paper towel saturated solution potassium nitrate saturated solution mean dissolved much chemical water possible hang paper dry sure wipe drip dry ready cut small strip light edge see different act ordinary paper ignite stubborn mixture ignite gunpowder turn ignite anything else nt dip towel potassium nitrate solution second time try make  stronger  actually make le effective fancier paper towel nt work well best result obtained cheap folded paper towel found public restroom everywhere self igniting mixture pulverize gram potassium permanganate crystal place asbestos board earthenware vessel let  drop glycerine fall onto potassium permanganate mixture eventually sizzle flare potassium permanganate oxidizing agent glycerine oxidized quickly heat generated faster dissipated consequently glycerine ignited mixture take long catch fire sometimes useful time delay needed set mixture lose patience test throw mixture away wastebasket either bury flush toilet know least one house fire started done given time stuff start burn demonstration produce nice effect sends lot poisonous fume outside make mound equal volume iodine crystal aluminum dust make small indentation top mound add drop two water move away hiss burst flame generating thick purple smoke fume iodine vapor caustic make sure upwind fire since set moisture store mixed material mix immediately plan use shred small piece newspaper place small amount sodium peroxide add two drop hot water paper ignited caution keep sodium peroxide moisture contact organic material skin example ammonium nitrate gram gram ammonium chloride grind separately add  gram zinc dust form cone add  drop water bright blue flame large volume smoke form depending quality zinc dust may need increase quantity zinc since ignited moisture attempt store mixture percussion explosive section introduce couple mixture interesting possibility also demonstrate sensitive mixture containing potassium chlorate keep mind chlorate mixture lot sensitive one shown mix part weight sulfur part potassium chlorate ground separately mortar mixed lightly without pressure sheet paper small amount mixture le one gram placed hard surface struck hammer explode loud report mix following part weight way potassium chlorate lampblack sulfur mixture flammable mix small quantity lead azide pb n unlike many explosive must enclosed casing explode others require detonator set lead azide explode open air either due heat percussion mixed gum arabic glue tiny dot placed match head make trick exploding match mixture coated onto   wood splinter used  load  cigar larger amount used detonator moderately light tap set making much sensitive percussion explosive already mentioned easy make take  gram sodium azide dissolve water best use water necessary separate container dissolve  gram lead nitrate using much water needed get dissolve two clear liquid mixed white precipitate lead azide settle mixture add lead nitrate solution stirring lead azide precipitate may need use note weight given convenience necessary scale give approximate proportion needed need continue mix solution precipitate form precipitate filtered rinsed several time distilled water good idea store wet form le sensitive way best store possible keep flexible plastic container wont produce sharp fragment case explosion gram time also make sure mouth container wiped clean putting lid shock removing lid enough set dry powder wedged container stopper nt forget removed precipitate filter paper still enough left make filter paper explosive lead azide powerful well sensitive never make couple gram one time reaction equation lead sodium lead sodium nitrate azide azide nitrate pb nan  pb n nano nt try salvage sodium nitrate left dissolved water sodium nitrate cheap really useful good pyrotechnic batch contaminated poisonous lead worthless stuff dump demonstrate power little bit lead azide cut piece touch paper following shape                                           size wide rectangle one inch x  inch length little fuse least  inch apply thin layer wet lead azide large rectangle paint brush let dry thoroughly done set tester open light fuse tip step back done properly tiny bit white powder produce fairly loud explosion lead azide booby trap get string heavy enough wo nt break jerked hard couple foot enough test may want use longer piece depending plan fold small  z
