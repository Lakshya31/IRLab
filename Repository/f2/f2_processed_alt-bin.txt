note uudecodeing gif pic etc file intended general introduction group altbinariespictures answering common question concerning picture posted namely decode view course possible cover everything try get much file feel something important omitted know subject well please write include info future release contacted via internet readdm ccwfccutexasedu miss important detail contained file let  prerepeat  tried make program mentioned document available anonymous ftp bongoccutexasedu  gifstuff directory think omitted something important viewersonly archive feel free let know also gif file kind site save time nt bother looking ok  real reason reading document  table content downloading decoding file ii gif file gif viewer iii gl file iv picture type v encoding uploading file vi alternate source picture vii abp abpd viii common problem ix appendix awk sed perl script downloading decoding file far common method posting file altbinariespictures uuencode standard program shipped standard implementation unix convert binary file plaintext ascii file handled mail system need version uudecode anything else order view anything downloaded net system version uudecode available get one via anonymous ftp bongoccutexasedu  gifstuffuuxfer directory first step save file want view  version newsreader done pressing followed immediately space note rn allow space thoughsq file name usually asked want save mailbox format answer n case singlepart file uudecode file create whatever output file encoded usually tell singlepart file looking subject line standard nettiquette make somthing like  part subjet line indicates part part file number usually assume part file feel free write poster directly  please nt waste bandwidth posting request heshe put info subject line nice multipart file life little difficult standard uudecode program need trim header trailer part concatenate resulting file together make one big file run uudecode use favorite text editor strip header trailer file unix system use cat part part part  partn uudecode concatenate pipe uudecode downloaded file msdos system concatenating use copy part part part  partn file concatenate several version uudecode including uuexe msdos program written richard mark uuxfer program several people written script awk sed perl strip header trailer concatenate result pipe uudecode see section ix appendix want run one going download home machine move around network remember output going binary file set transfer protocol accordingly ii gif file gif viewer ok got great gif file downloading running uudecode gif stand graphic interchange format standard format image developed compuserve deviceindependent method storing picture includes lempelzivwelch lzw compression make file fairly small need gif viewer order view file xwindows workstation program need called xloadimage system xloadimage get via anonymous ftp bongoccutexasedu gifstuffxwindowsxloadimage directory note good one like xv xshowgifsq macintosh good one quickgif run color mac monochrome mac use visionlab msdos system personally use vpic exist others including cshow nice bonus using cshow also view several common picture format

gif file spectrum file type viewed software sorry nt know called finally apple ec type advised use iigif view gif file computer advice g user use shrconvert tried make abovementioned gif viewer available bongoccutexasedu gifstuff directory hunt filelist file see something need available system viewer consult sysytem administrator local user group machine post asking gif viewer specific machine iii gl file commonly people post file net gl extension file actually animated pictureshows viewed ibmpc machine grasprt program grasp graphic system professional system developed paul mace payware system transmitting animated file grasprt program public domain believe runtime version viewing file unfortunately grasprt exists pcclone family recently wonderful netpeople written x windowsbased gl viewer called xgl also another called xgrasp know little source available exportlcsmitedu  look directory keep contributed x code also endeavor maintain copy bongoccutexasedu ca nt promise uptodate recently amiga version written  find amiga directory bongo another twist grasprt older version admitted cga monitor newer one allows vga well unfortunately older version nt even recognize vga standard newer version btw much faster old one let display vga grasp file cga ega monitor unlike gif standard gl file resoultionindependent anyway system pcclone x system amiga afraid may luck sorry usually gl file huge people often compress one several popular compressionarchiving package perhaps common pc family pkzip package gl file posted zip extension know ziped similarly z extension compressed unix compress utility encounter file ziped pc go find copy pkunzip simtel one dont pc get c source code unziper simtel pd unixcfilemgmt unziptarz decompress unix compress utility file compressed unix compress utility unix box clearly problem hand box need decompressor find msdos version unix compress obtained simtel pd msdossqusq wuarchivewustledu mirrorsmsdossqusq file compdzip iv picture type type singlepicture file posted net although common gif file suppose next common type picture posted macpaint picture picture decoded viewable macintosh standard macpaint program pcclone family picture viewable among progams cshow difference viewing software downloadingdecoding encodinguploading procedure identical type picture another common form picture take iff file standard picture amiga know many program computer amiga allow viewing file exist program amiga convert iff file gif file rest u see pointed deluxepaint ibmpc family work iff file verified occasionally people get argument standard best think answer care thing say matter almost every machine sun already program written view gif file nt shareware pd source code available almost everywhere v encoding uploading file common question asked one post net basic answer anything like see get nittygritty post say thing loose etiquette posting note paragraph specific altsexpictures still relevant first thing probably best restrict one two image per day know got mb xxxrated gif file girlfriend engaged various act host small furry animal dying distribute world however net get severely loaded image since typically kb post ten lot people frantically downloading show weekly arbitron rating altsexpictures account something like entire net traffic alt traffic need selfpolicing asp going avoid axed nervous sysadmins second sure give subject line informative like crash burngif plane crash air show xx  notice includes everything file name short description resolution part many one insist leaving everything else least say part third actual message posting sure give least brief description like crash burngif xx part th series plane crash beruit air show taken every single conveivable angle one taken photograph guy happened standing directly plane came pulitzer prize material least camera saved also checksum nice people access sum program help people indentify erroneous transmission usually people say thing like checksum obtained  bsd sum sysv sum r cut line part part etc  finally got file ftp site announced net nt bother posting odds say everyone dog already really need careful wasting bandwidth unsure whether interest post short message saying  file mail want copy  people say want one post  one bozo outer mongolia want sure bet picture already made round ok  howto posting first thing first gif file nt bother trying run compression routine  wont work lzw compression kind used gif file efficient compression scheme happens one used many common compression routine including standard unix compress utility try compress gif file usually end getting bigger ok need uuencode file find encoder encode output file particularly large ie kb would wise split encoded file smaller part kb post split file text editor like  use richard mark uuexe uuxfer program post multipart file sure add line data say cut people trimming header trailer hand know cut recent addition etiquette also make line say begin   cut end   cut obvious location simple awk perl script handle multipart file another nice thing put part  number file afore mentioned super uuencode program important make  cut  part mixedcase lowercase letter decoder detect data based presence character belong normal uuencoding character set choke line uppercase since line contain character belong set mix case decoder fine  remember add  begin   end  keywords make  begin   end  cap exsting script wont miss uudecoders wo nt choke post file  remember include neat info mentioned earlier like subject line mean something description checksum etc  one thing pointed recently certain newsreader nn example sort article alphabetically title subject line part number get displayed saved order obvious common way torpedo process make subject line follow sequentially example first article subject  plane crash gif crash burn part  subsequent article subject  crash burn part n  subject line displayed sorted correctly nn however change arrangement little like first article subject  crash burn part  plane crash gif  subsequent article subject  crash burn part n  please nnusers world posting vi alternate source picture altbinariespictures certainly source picture gif file type available see section iv likely place find picture archive reachable via ftp ftp stand file transfer protocol program transmitting file network use ftp need access computer ftp program network connection ftp program allow enter something like ftp wsmrsimtelarmymil connect mighty simtel archive white sand missile range occasionally encounter ftp program old enough slothful enough recognize internetstyle address like one case need know computer numeric address simtel would enter ftp  connected tell computer end want log entering user machine save step assuming want log else would want prompted account name enter anonymous asks password enter internet address often machine trying connect busy ie many anonymous user case machine inform throw try later well need know file stored want know cd directoryname directory question dir find see file called crash burngif want well first thing tell computer end want transmit binary file ftp server entering magic word tenex machine nt recognize tenex try binary else fails enter type l sure gif file get garbage try view ready grab file want two option type get filename mget wildcard wildcard unixstyle wildcard mget get file satisfy specification done grabbing file type quit bye log remote machine return word anonymous ftp gif file log onto remote machine via anonymous ftp please try restrict ten minute transmission time five ten file imagine people discover new archive gif file hot download every one often jam site day notice effect first time bozo announces name new gif archive wo nt able get without persistent effort several hour even day two system administrator site notice  worth anonymous ftp last two day revoke anonymous ftp privilege every one screwed considerate grab file let someone else chance probably wo nt solve problem long term still everyone dog ftping machine least spread wealth bit raging debate erupts altsexpictures every week concerning whether announce new anonymous ftp site gif file issue never settled everyone satisfaction add two cent discussion discover site keep name pas friend word spread slowly site bear instantly heavy load however announce world found site everyone descend upon like flock vulture rotting cow site invariably remove gif file sound like better idea common method obtaining file archival file server work following way send mail server address oneline command message like help directory picturesgiffamilyoriented send picturesgiffamilyorientedcrash burngif requested info sent back later time server time get around first step discover server system send help command learn command server however server operate command basically similar listed vii altbinariespictures altbinariespicturesd two newsgroups work basically like compbinariesibmpc cbipd group one posting new material one discussing post issue basic idea picture post abp anything else anything anything anything else post abpd truth feel bad posting file abp picture however benefit restricting request info outweigh detriment breaking recentlyunwritten rule please post anything altbinariespictures picture sort viii common problem well downloaded file tried view got garbage went wrong two likely place something go wrong transmission file first downloaded file home computer remember tell modem transfer software sending binary file secondmost likely forgot say tenex grabbed file via ftp either result mangled file unviewable anything known man also remember trim header trailer information arewere using  simple  uudecoder symptom forgetting usually message something like  short file  gif viewer note also seen problem blank line left part anywhere matter within begin end line uuencoded file uudecode get fine gif viewer choke result blank line seen get one end statement beware taking much enough header trailerssq another common problem one ibm mainframe often use ebcdic character set instead ascii set used everyone else would nt problem except asciiebcdic converter bug mung translation several character including others even would nt problem except particular munging map several character onto wrong character ooops way around use uuencode transfer file use xxencode produce file look almost exactly like uuencoded file use character set ibmproof using ibm mainframe host computer trouble decoding file likely problem solution find kind soul willing uudecode file xxencode send get file via ftp ebcdicproof get better computer us everybody else character set last least likely problem mailer somewhere actually munged file happens fortunately nt happen often please check problem first post abpd request someone send working copy enough people post request sort eventually original poster usually repost person problem someone bound send file save net hundred thousand dollar ix appendix awk sed perl script script mentioned section make assurance well work use
