hideseek v steganography program pc welcome hideseek v radical update hideseek v includes lot new feature first interface  command line fact longer run hideseek command line second importantly hideseek work lot display resolution x hopefully make lot usefull begin steganography steganography hiding data data later run hideseek type  hideseek  c prompt away go hideseek do program nt know happen try run window  never hideseek presented main screen may use mouse one click doublebordered box button type highlighted letter select option option gif file select gif file use hiding seeking data hiding eventually asked name output gif file greyscale gifs work best hiding data file select data file file either hidden choose hide data name output file seeking data note must empty output file key input key lock data file key encrypts header hideseek us idea algorithm although encrypt data function usefull want make hard people get data  key seek use key click key radio button clear key button selected using key wether see one also say  none  key box using key key  none   know notice key box blink hide data remind used key get rid blinking pressing key entering new key key clear key key input box radio button automatically clear enter key  button selected key see browse take file browsing screen documented later view show gif file selected read show data file selected quit quits program hide hide data file gif file asks name output gif file seek look data gif file writes data file  data file must empty browse screen bunch function looking directory file file box let enter file path name use change disk directory select file mask select file directory box let look direcory tree may press escape leave box without making choice drive box let change drive mask button let select file mask affect directory display show  loadview  selector let decide load view given file gif data file view button show file selected button sensitive loadview button load button load file return main screen quit button return main screen without loading file error message pretty selfexplanatory one thing watch tell display gif file hideseek support video card required resolution may suggest resize gif using separate program try data hidden file resize data would lost hideseek pretty slow large gif andor data file please patient apologize slowness hideseek make output gif hiding match display size original gif size annoying life specifically fastgraph graphic toolbox note whole display including black area around gif get used hiding process part new gif  resize                                      steganography work case making subtle reversible alteration gif file basically take loworder bit pixel us encode bit character thus pixel encode character creates noticeable  noise  picture unless use greyscale gif case noise due way greyscale palette work carefull analysis gif might able detect hidden data may depends gif hideseek really usefull must use greyscale gifs color gifs obvious hideseek try secure using pseudorandom number generator  disperse  data throughout gif  thus pixel contain data impossible tell pixel contain data thus rendering hidden data secure hideseek need remember file size seed prng order carry succesfully thus writes header gif file first thing since sneaky encodes header using idea algorithm key supply supply want make data hard extract literally billion possible file given gif million possible key try guess actually  possible seed try guess making weak link chain without key nt know file length someone sneaky devious hide encrypted data well telling whether pull junk real secret file included ideaexe simple encryption program use best possible program adequate see ideadoc file info
