next page never heard  shareware  purchased disk xyz software house advertises great software per disk may asking following question  going already bought assembler  answer well exactly bought disk great software nt bought software yet like vast majority software offered  perdisk distribution house freedistribution software also known  shareware   usersupported software  mean retain right choose let people pas around business relationship distribution house u nt get penny whatever paid disk containing need expect paid make living making supporting shareware product distribution house pretty poor job revealing shareware nature software sell thought purchased software free clear might feel justified angry misled might look around house better job informing public hope take time consider everybody role shareware marketing scene think conclude although may misled nt really cheated anything shareware great author like spent year computer hole learning great programmer time business school learning marketing distribution technique simply cast program wind distributed practically cost u charge le cost  commercial  software  shareware also great customer like try software paying know successful shareware product good satisfied customer pay existence shareware infuses healthy competition entire software market price quality case utterly convinced never find better value assembler anywhere finally let consider distribution house provide legitimate service charge reasonable price best house act librarian evaluating cataloguing software pay thousand dollar advertising cut far le distributor cut  commercial  software prosper volume bigger customer distribution house repeat customer aware happy getting nt xyz house might never heard might never figured obtain hope happy shareware actively desire support feel good promoting healthy situation everybody encourage best programmer world keep writing instead big corporation said let move package package consists four
