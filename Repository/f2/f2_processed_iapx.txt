machine herewith warned   small program need  course may think  program may dox four time big executable  try tell iapx program designed showing data internals computer may use case buy sell computer check cpu andor npx type clock rating known bug  normal  use may one following meet friend new machine nt know anything like get info forgot computer hardware technician service kit run small program instead working hardware folk wo nt let open computer method much  user friendly  faster even neat discover result ca nt get staring hardware want buy new computer board neither trust company sell board chip intend run novell netware machine want know cpu known error even netware check solution simply start iapx test cpu known least bug correct may safely purchase board highly recommend buy

cpu idrev supported reset idrev dx step see next section detail every single line like mention machine type based computer ever met bug  line output suggest  ok look line seperately try explain content meaning     main processor                         guess type cpu use iapx ability check following type intel intel intel intel sx nec v intel dx nec v intel sx intel intel dx intel measurement clock rating selection appropriate cpu test display cpu info based type check error routine would likely mess part output possibly whole system well note iapx determine using dx sx sx attached sx full dx sx disabled sx active running plug risk buddy system still running iapx mention using sx npx failed responding     clock rating                         iapx try measure rating clock drive cpu andor npx unfortunately easy task decided implement two indepentent test check value nt worried two rate describe clock personally think test better method measurement intend remove second test future version discover big difference two value please let know please tell type cpu running environment active testing qemm dv window mode o version mode c measurement clock nasty use one newer clone cpu amd c something like cpu look like intel work like intel faster using cpu appreciate output iapx get timing newer release     test cpu known bug                    several known bug intel cpu running computer world even clone coming amd thought could interesting eg buy board whole machine see processor one many buggy version still sale today example three four tested machine office popa bug hopefully compiler generate  cpu bug tolerant  code might hang error try diagnose mostly relate special cpu type eg testing every cpu proper operation intruction set give possibility  idiv mem bug early version processor faulted tried idiv negative divisor memory register far never discovered cpu messed test must admit never met person  rep instr also bug one early version pro cessor cpu got hold signal working rep instr cycle served hold afterwards  forgot  take work rep never found faulty cpu till  popa common bug machine tested machine faulty seems bug fixed recentl sx version dx got sofar bad even amd chip symptom sometimes processor mess ax register popa instruction depends next opcode give eat fix problem instruction simply put nop instruction popa work fine try one buggy cpu mess ax register mov axh mov bx mov di pusha popa mov cx bxdi mean odd unusual sequence instruction whats mov cx  operation done correctly popa fails see iapxdat original data based test seems bit also bit operation cause problem iapx check bug using bit version also able test  cpu  bit mul bit mul le common error may encounter bug early version dx processor never got one buggy unit even novell kindo check wo nt operate discovered see iapxdat information  bit stosb heard bit stosb instruction problem sometimes may correctly increment high word edi register nt find faulty cpu  bswap one german computer magazine rumoured bswap instruction work correctly would swap one half forget swap half check well  cmpxchg read cmpxchg instruction yielding int invalid opcode cpu     information cpu register           may interesting eg intend write nasty asm program like one system table hidden setting cpu flag output show intdesctable limitff basec adress length interruptdescriptortable user think located  even use qemm something similar wrong globdesctable limitf base address length globaldescriptortable flag pe mp em iopl et  static  system flag may useful take look problem sort program eg npx sensitive software pe bit protect enable set processor protected mode though do nt run protected mode mean supervisor task qemm max switched cpu v virtual mode mode emulate various lookalike task time normally one task active task do v mode let supervisor task shadow ram swap memory mp bit monitor coprocessor set t exception generated cpu encounter wait instruction em bit emulate coprocessor set exception generated time coprocessor instruction going executed aid bit enable floating point emu lation em coprocessor timing performed et bit extension type former version documentation mentioned know bit got correct meaning set mean attached npx bit set bit used able run npx cpu iopl io privilege level used control use special instruction memory area protection scemes circumstance even pe     numerix processor                       show type coprocessor cpu attached note easy might think example use together may interesting  right  coprocessor active clock rating coprocessor may interesting obtain  fast socket  running alter clock rating npx retaining clock rating main processor iapx also detects npx software emulation check emulator try compatible     computing cpu id revision               reset dx register sxdx hold value indicating type processor revision easy get data described issue reset get info unfortunately reset hardest hit cpu please alarmed mess around option taken precaution prevent system hang data corruption includes flushing chache buffer eg hyperdisk  never problem option told crash eg intel inboard prevent system spurious hang test executed option  r  reset stated command line output look like reset idrev sx step c added decoding could find idrev word implemented maybe get unknown value revision step intel processor design usually increase time therefore higher revision lower byte dx indicate newer release known id dx sx sl dxsx far know least sx step c dx step faulty intend buy
