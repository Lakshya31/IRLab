note carefully  call waiting   call forwarding  information article correct bell canada territory primarily province quebec ontario canada checked area controlled telephone company  modem communication problem  written graham newton po box mill ontario mc c n occasionally compuserve  also canada remote system people experienced trouble typically dumped mid transmission system yet similar problem others natural thing blame system read following information may surprised could simple cure problem various telephone company offering useful service called call waiting practical purpose give two phone line one phone word phone someone else call hear ring instead getting busy signal person presently talking hear momentary beep tell another call waiting answer call momentarily depressing hookswitch put current caller hold talk new caller switch back forth caller also momentarily depressinmg hookswitch time great service serious problem modem user beep hear signal another call waiting also momentarily black audio  modem end end think lost carrier brief duration may disconnect depending terminal software andor modem type involved fortunately cure problem within another service call forwarding phone company usually offer package deal call waiting method work note misinformation circulated effect call waiting disabled simple user code  come hacker bb usa may work work service allows forward call coming another phone number enter whenever activate service forwarded phone ring half ring every call forwarded number entered remind line forwarding line used outgoing call without causing busy forwarded call interesting point  forwarding outgoing call longer interrupted manner modem call affected must however originate call since incoming call forwarded another number ca nt access nt second line house forward whereupon could still answer forwarded call also forward call number ring busy anyone calling whether line using line half ring everytime someone attempt reach remind line forwarding simple code entered phone line disconnect forwarding becomes normal trouble got dumped variety traced carrier level low either sending end receiving end system calling remember telephone line variable amount signal loss depending many exchange call pass reaching desired destination dont control aspect seems people operate touch tone equipped line consistantly better simple basic black dial telephone service reason appears touch tone line carefully controlled dial pulse line hence consistant another common problem appears acoustic coupled modem one stuff handset earmuff type receptacle dial hear carrier sent system called telephone mouthpiece suffer compacted carbon granule modem user equivalent going deaf ear word mouthpiece becomes insensitive sound distant end hears low level carrier quick easy cure unfortunately work older model type telephone use carbon type microphone simply unscrew mouthpiece remove little round capsule fall hand rap sharply time around perimeter replace shake loose carbon granule make better transmission level case lower speed modem baud possible undesirable difference modem mark space tone thus making receiving end modem appear deaf modem putting lower level needed making operation mariginal subject small variation amplitude one telephone line v another cheap modem real problem manufacturer ca nt pay attention matter without raising price substantially partly reason good modem cost money frequency counter audio generator available check low speed send receive frequency following list originate mode mark hz  space hz answer mode mark hz  space hz system see hz difference mark space frequency hz originate answer filter mean filter must accurate little variance tolerated another possible problem le likely mismatch word length stop bit parity check parity check coding modem sends system calling system default n bit word parity one stop bit make information transfer word system deal equipment nt set match format adjust setting conform insideously subtle problem possibility location responsible revealing apparent fault design modem supplier may know even think trying duplicate fault condition testing caused close proximity broadcast transmitting station case low frequency paging fm tv broadcast common carrier service transmitter case high frequency way example one case modem user close within mile  watt radio station transmitter operates khz modem constantly acting home worked ok office much away transmitter tip could hear music voice telephone line corresponding program station course happening selfrespecting telephone complaint call phone repair service got service man install surpressors charge curing music spurious talk problem modem however still acting although substantially le phone company fix applied confirmed fact entire problem due rectification break radio signal audio circuit modem various way cured boil necessity locating stage rectification taking place eliminating point usually one place circuit problem originates frequently high gain stage like preamplifier active filter shotinthedark bandaid fix usually reduce problem dont eliminate proper diagnostic technique applied result complete fix problem recently advent higher speed modem use complex algorithm code data problem line noise appear substantially affect slower speed modem lot comment regarding line noise related problem also great deal mystery surrounding mechanism noise originates user anything noise usually take form short impulse clicking noise longer crackling static noise effect noise directly seen monitor give clue type noise probable origin following quote hayes smartmodem owner manual show happens noise corrupts data transmission  error occurs data bit lost low speed baud result terminal screen printer single error either incorrect missing character error high speed baud multiplied however due path character take output printing display least two often three character incorrect result single bit error descrambling algorithm alters data error often produced left brace lower case letter interpret hardware defect  impulse noise often produce single bit error described however problem encountered burst anywhere ten character assume plagued static noise variety alternate path selection used phone company local long distance call completion equipment try complete call different way alternate routing available central office find trunk desired end office busy abandon call give fast trunk busy busy signal alternate routing may run call older noisy office hence one possible answer hangingup redialing often get better line cause noise determines type noise phone company central office impulse noise produced older switching equipment call system routed one older office chance may pick impulse noise natural phenomenon static discharge lightning contribute well man made noise electrical switching circuit may induce impulse noise nearby phone line anywhere along way problem usually minimal phone line balanced ground thus tend cancel kind commonmode noise one likely cause static variety noise line protector block installed every phone line terminating location designed surge protector lightning etc carbon fuse element known become noisy problem caused consistant higher ringing voltage normal switching transient pick line clear problem temporarily minute hour day maybe even month experience static problem described call telephone repair service order simply tell hearing loud static noise line sometimes go away bounce switchhook time suspect line protector block defective would like replaced nt mention modem computer start suggesting get expensive data line nt needed make sure remove attachment nt approved phone company employee come job avoid likely problem complaining cause line come think sure equipment connected line cause problem noise go away gadget disconnected one cause phone company supplied equipment
