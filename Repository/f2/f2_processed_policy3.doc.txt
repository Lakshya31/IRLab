send mail must one order others send mail first step obtaining current node list locate fido bulletin board help bulletin board list include least fido system usually identify nt hard sysop fido system node list available downloading probably tell get one node list must determine network region cover area network always three digit number network restricted area region generally preferred since provide service member find network cover area pick region region always two digit number united state divided ten region certainly region even near network located network region area send request node number node zero network region   request must sent fidonet mail must include least following name name system city state system located phone number used calling system hour operation maximum baud rate support coordinator may want additional information contact please allow least two week node number request processed send request regional coordinator may forward request network coordinator cover area may take longer  going  going node extended period day  two inform coordinator soon possible system still try reach    much annoyance everyone   circumstance put answering

 probably want coordinator know temporary condition happens away  join network  join network independent node would like join network area must contact network coordinator reached sending fidonet mail node zero network inform special mail schedule andor routing required network regional coordinator contact confirm wish join network placed network informed network coordinator many advantage network first foremost help reduce congestion fidonet national mail hour also many network  outbound  well  inbound  substantially reduce phone bill addition network member receive regular update node list fidonews independent node may  form network  form network several node area network may wish form several advantage outlined first step contact sysops area must decide node comprise network node going
