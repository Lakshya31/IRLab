accessed local pot dialupport system known  host  psn pay connection psn depending transmission speed protocol type psns offer efficient data transfer le rate compared typical circuit switched call thus anyone would interested transferring large amount data either psn circuit system psn would result increase convenience due reduction data transmission error cost another feature psn speed data translation take place psn pad packet assemblerdisassembler host example one could connect psn pad bps pad could connect host system bps still allow user receive error free transmission  flow control  done actual increase decrease data packet pad user pad host psns also ability interconnect special gateway might allow one user dialed one psn pad connected another psn pad system accessible first almost every psn world accessed gateway one psn another psn subsequent gateway target psn achived course always exception private small data network may reachable gateway system reached usually direct dialins psns allow caller execute  collect call  host system accept although majority host given psn accept collect call connect host system accept collect call one must posse network user identifier nui access private system psn accepts collect call ability access another psn identifier discussed document part v network protocol             psn utilizes several communication protocol similar communication protocol used typical asynchronous modem however psns utilize synchronous communication x type protocol versus typical modem asynchronous v protocol result pad psn also serf synchronousasynchronous translator synchronous netowrk asynchronous modem psns offer network speed snail pace baud rate bps asynchronous lightning  bps synchronous common data protocol used psns today x protocol thus one able access private pad offered support x protocol one could access virtually network user address nua pad sprintnet pad support x protocol one nui sort one also could access nua sprintnet pad see appendix f list network protocol part vi pad security           sprintnet pad dialin pad general  immediate  form telephone security common within system plainly sprintnet psn dialin

presence nui without nui one would usually stuck able call system accepting collect call sans use another system nui one aspect seucurity worth mentioning whenever packet data sent host system header data sent stating originating  call  placed thus connecting   local pot dialinport owned address  h  system would know call originated h someone abusing system psn system saved log originating address accessing system owner abused system could easily determine pot dialinport number abuser using inform psn security possible abuse dialin local area ability  trace  originating address one way foil one could connect another pad pad connect target system thus pot dialinport address sent connected pad connected pad would intercept pot address send connected pad address target system instead pot
