                                       definitive guide old roland instrument plus                                          part one update apr                                large list every roland instrument came midi also contains stuff relative structure instrument much cost well use availability wish credit good friend bandmate roommate titonton duvante helping information well james towning  go                                        shx series                                        shx series line keyboard roland first sold came late basically synths usually half size three octave odd configuration knob switch polyphony course multitimbral closest thing moogs coming time except condensed made wood hear circuitry sh similar  synths usually control voltagegate input external synth sequencer sort  sh  stand synth wondering sh synth                                        sh closest sh readily available synth later except pitch lever think ability generate pink white noise synths vco voltage controlled oscillator vcf voltage controlled filter vca voltage controlled amplifier well think envelope follower would suppose synth would neighborhood  seeing extremely rare find ie never ever seen sale anywhere might small synthesizer used generate classic  low bass  sound well lot percolating random noise people like make pad simulation string synths setting attack little slower turning frequency cutoff bit sh sh sh think sh know sh like  size keyboard high control panel back control panel port patch cord external audio input cvgate out  quite knob course idea precisely modular series roland system xm series                                        roland modular series two set know hand modular system stand modular synths modular way lot moog equipment small module filter oscillator amplifier envelope follower could stack together connect via patch cord could control sound using cvgate keyboard output modular system tone module one thing think roland allowed people make module work could modify personal need could add knob envelope follower think basic system vco vcf vca envelope follower nt know included multiple module  system  per se  say instrument would jump shit one money get one right interested stuff                                        almighty x x series sh mc tb                                        part famous roland equipment series synths deritives thereof utilizing circuitry minor sound modification go go go go  sh                                        two octave digitalanalog hybrid synth pretty popular feature everything sh except switchable white pink noise pitchmodulation lever trigger lfo modulate sound well external modulation grip grip small wheel grip modulation nothing else attach strap side wear wweeee like guitar came several color grey blue red purple also heard white one sure suppose could spray paint wanted say digitalanalog hybrid refering fact clock run digitally difference running clock digitally analogally  haha waveform oscillation peak point trigger dependable way timing interference kind fun stuff fuck digital clock make dependable fluctuate cvgate th jack also modification add modification allow line input vcf shape line input control frequency cutoff resonance modulation etc email detail small battery inside store note sequence hold function hold note last played also arpeggiator go like philip glass type stuff waveform sawtooth square noise random wave like sh wavelength distance range  foot low frequency high frequency noise generator add noise whatever playing usually find  always easy find look pawn shop shit course traded bass guitar mine last year october mc                                        mc stand microcomposer little angel except never use way much hassle call little angel thing produce deepest roundest bass ever seen love death wait midi anyway machine basically circuitry sh sh synth minus ability go different waveform think stuck square wave maybe maybe sawtooth much think make bass sound think bass machine intention product supposed would write entire song step time course could play back change tempo portamento accent could save song tape also load tape well also two channel mode allowed record one channel think record another channel machine two note polyphonic one note pin sync jack two sync out unreliably start stop sequence even drum pattern even assume also cvgate jack good playing small button pain butt ugh  btw machine think made maybe  rather hard find got mine analogics ne ohio phone call basically asking took last january thought would replacement nonexistant time got saw later rogue never saw one far know dan curtin two people ohio use techno tb bassline                                        assume tb stand something like  bassline   tone bass  whatever case also called acid machine  etc used later house music phuture adonis derrick may drug acid would sounded like along probably one famous machine roland ever made heart squaresawtooth wave knob top machine control wave tuning frequency cutoff attack resonance decay accent wave switchable square sawtooth wave lfo noise filter anything run think dco  digitally controlled oscillator think actually machine run dco anyway  computer controlled  sequencer machine store pattern split group group pattern b also tie pattern together make song must program pattern step time ugh rest sound staccato moving tempo click legato extending several click arbitrarily programmed start continue usually piss around find something happy usually case write mode hit pitch hit tap let hear note sequence one one keep hitting tap hit slide accent really fucked slide accent orbital us well acid stuff intention simulate bass guitar somehow nt really see natural bass guitar think like electronic bullfrog percolating electronic coffee pot weird find day batch good luck picked mine pawn shop asking could nt get work store heh heh asked would take got home later day many basslines programmed heard people selling  actual blue book price sure people know demand machine jack say good luck sh polyphonic synth                                        joe lesesne aka raver say heard sh  polyphonic yet never made mass production reason ca nt exactly go great detail synth since information hard come know anything please send information include faq                                        weird roland shit r vk mc msq                                        r organstring synth                                        organstring synth essentially knobless exception wavelength generator low high pitch chorus attack release stringorgan button highly resonant string section  perky  organ sound weird synth cvgate yet allows external input go chorus part circuitry wild ran esq made lot nice addition sound vk electronic organ                                        bliss  ahh drawbar oh love drawbar two section sine wave bright wave series drawbar order    button percussive force organ soft nd rd decay also button sine bright wave plus vibrato fast one simulate leslie  ahhh  chorus effect love thing nice string sound really kinda breathy pad wish could control something else seeing cvgate output input suggestion msq digital sequencer                                        msq dandy little box cheaply convert midi sync data use instrument mc tb tr tr usually find close  sometimes find pawn shop owner drug ask pasha mc analogue track sequencer                                        mc analogue sequencer would drive separate cvgate output use roland instuments system sh etc  list price nt even know see one  end  sine
