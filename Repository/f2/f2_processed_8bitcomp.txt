absolutely original unmodified form bear original copyright notice seen past week exciting working programming first homebrew bit computer article far last word building computer intended serve eyeopener interested inner working computer going explain every facet  bit computer project could easily fill several reference volume would require authorship true professional simply going describe little creation preparation leading design construction actual process designing building computer long process finding correcting initial hardware problem  bug  current ongoing exploration computer capability programming side thing first started researching low level intricacy bit computer three year ago reading steve ciarcia monthly column byte magazine called  circuit cellar  first seen column early glanced old issue byte curiosity unfortunately steve longer writes byte magazine due opinion questionable attitude management lucky reader steve founded excellent magazine along fellow electrical engineer devoted hardware  hacking  called circuit cellar ink addition beginner like industry pro communicate calling cci bb mentioned later detail monthly column steve would present working project along schematic thorough explanation schematic diagram detailed plan blueprint electronic circuit project included bit multipurpose control computer called micro controller  smart  printer spooler logic ic integrated circuit tester many interesting topic last three article even detailed multiprocessing super computer never built project month taught computer design gave idea project around time purchased book dealing motorola microprocessor family explained great detail working bit microprocessor system also sent letter semiconductor company motorola rockwell texas instrument asking information microprocessor memory peripheral product company wonderful myriad free reference manual sent one year period time probably mailed letter mostly motorola good deal texas instrument reply received least bookshelf worth valuable information form product flier reference manual application note application note usually sample design incorporating certain product specific task company obliging engineer use semiconductor product chip sell money make nevertheless free information supplied week worth reading material learned great deal year later decided design robot based article found issue byte carefully drew schematic diagram simple circuit hand three sheet graph paper microprocessor chose robot learned book anyway first attempt say  thing got messed  understatement ordered part expensive piece equipment  burn  eprom chip later realized nt know begin worse yet science fair month away detail cloudy head reason probably idea project scrapped think continued read electronics year two year ago decided go ahead build normal computer board wheel robot able get parent buy expensive schematic drawing program called schema ibm clone computer enable draw better diagram designed computer around microprocessor mpu ordered part would nt ya know  social life got way joined school production musical cabaret nt start building project till february st science fair month away thing went hay wire cut corner build quickly made mess second year row thinking back project design pretty good one flaw given enough time might gotten work know okay enough crazy made mind build computer really build one time summer vacation school started back september case lost track excellent timekeeping went back computer spent time schema terrific program expensive definitely worth ever penny electrical engineer came straight forward design bit computer built around mhz mpu expansion bus capable addressing k offboard inputoutput memory k ram k eprom lcd serial port capable operation k baud led push button position dip switch let explaining case term nt clear used operating clock frequency megahertz mhz computer certain clock frequency dictate fast instruction fetched memory executed everything mpu synchronized constant pulse train called clock megahertz clock speed mean mpu receives million clock cycle per second mega meaning million hertz meaning cycle repetition probably seen clock speed mhz higher computer catalog yes mhz mpu receives million clock pulse per second instruction mpu performs broken part part executed one clock cycle different instruction different execution time average instruction execution time clock cycle ranging cycle way cycle faster clock frequency faster mpu execute instruction nt use mhz clock frequency well first highest possible operating frequency family mhz second faster mpu operates expensive harder build computer get mhz need fast memory ai nt cheap careful technical problem arising radio interference computer signal line k ram mean kilobyte random access memory thinking back thing designed k ram  oh well random access memory term given memory written read ram known volatile memory retain information power removed chip something people nt realize memory quantity kilobyte number round number ram chip actually  byte ram  selected easier keep track youre wondering ram chip made hold  byte  isnt exactly round number computer operate binary base number system lowest level number computer power signal wire either two possible number  raised th power mean address signal line number needed access k ram k eprom mean kilobyte erasable programmable read memory memory nonvolatile meaning retains information even power normal operation memory written called read memory name implies certain condition chip programmed also erased special device known eprom programmer needed  burn  information chip high voltage electrical pulse another device known eprom eraser needed erase information chip reprogrammed erasure process accomplished high powered ultraviolet light source question use eprom ram well mpu dumb piece silicon wafer without program wo nt thing must always program immediately available computer powered eprom retains data almost indefinitely even power turned supply mpu instruction soon computer turned okay great make erasable perfect program developed nt make erasable prom chip initial stage development must able correct mistake eprom erasable engineer would waste dozen even hundred prom chip got program design correct believe matter perfect think program first time bound buggy gain experience number bug course decrease always popping least expect lcd acronym liquid crystal display seen lot time calculator watch maybe machine used display letter number graphic one used character display cheap though buying retailer set back one used character line display best place buy oddlot clearing house buy overstocked item manufacturer sell great price got three pretty good deal serial port actually composed two chip connector assorted electronic component first chip known either uart universal asynchronus receivertransmitter acia asynchronus communication interface adapter prefer uart two syllable chip heart serial port receives data mpu convert serial format sends second chip reverse take serial data chip convert bit byte use mpu used rockwell easy use complete chip many engineer recommended motorola make also uart nt like requires external clock source flexible heck made great mpu complain second chip known level converter standard logic level  volt known ttl logic ttl mean transistortransistor logic low level basic logic circuit circuit built r serial communication standard us   volt logic level somehow computer industry got stuck  great  idea design around level converter simply convert r signal ttl logic signal viceversa chip used max great product maxim semiconductor unlike standard chip used signal conversion require external   voltage source max convert v v v without external hardware minimizes circuit complexity increase cost little forgotten explaining part computer design last certainly least inputoutput io circuitry incorporated design allow status signaling user led user input keyboard consisting button switch way led acronym light emitting diode guy available several color name implies light miscellaneous io hardware tied together easy communication mpu pia another motorola product designed complement family mpus pia stand peripheral interface adapter bit io port controllable signal line connected led one port dip switch four button signal line figured work pia performed nicely allowed flexible control io device take back story building beast point designed computer schema okay design process communicated engineer cci bb asked little question offered much help soon three nice looking page schematic printed ready build computer ordered part mail order house silicon valley technique used called wire wrapping two basic method prototyping circuit prototyping first time building circuit along others soldering wire wrapping people like soldering steve ciarcia solder project someone said cci bb steve destined brain surgeon underside board really look like art u talented soldering become great mess melting insulation twisting turning burning eech previous project one built nt work called cci bb asked prototyping method general consensus wire wrap bought tool went ahead wire wrapping part previous project certainly success process easy learn year ordered wire assorted material necessary build project hefty bill paid parent paid started building think october november case finished week ready initial test december everything looked great scared hell try thing soon got nerve program eprom simple program plugged socket turned power rapid heart beat relaxed damn thing nt even cough sat power smoking explosion led going word lcd disappointed really expect work really looked something could nt possibly get work mean  build computer come computer computer lego set something like gave try still nothing happened checked design everything seemed okay checked wiring everything seemed okay okay decided check power rail took multi meter bought radio shack sale  multimeter instrument measure several electrical characteristic wire basic multimeter measure voltage resistance selected voltage mode put probe power rail hey found something voltage read almost meant either power supply functioning short checked power supply fine must short  called cci bb asked help two week later found short technique engineer explained okay ready plugged eprom nothing happened desperate try gave beginning january decided stop work february two week later logged onto cci bb always weekly found message waiting engineer silicon valley started working bit mpus sophomore high school junior beside point gave encouragement hint find short wrote back thanking encouragement telling found short computer still nt work confident design seen steve column new magazine circuit cellar ink soon replied troubleshooting technique first one simple test determine mpu actually executing instruction consisted single jump command keep jumping back tried worked amazing first time actually assurance design life knowing decided scrap fancy demo program wrote go simple led flasher wrote program burned eprom nt work disappointing nt give time first test worked hour playing around found problem three address line wired backwards address decoder chip time background bit microprocessor address kilobyte actually equal  byte address line since computer consist one big k ram eprom chip rather several smaller smaller term number byte occupy address space peripheral large address space must divided common denominator k chunk memory top three address line connected address decoder determines memory block currently active according three address line working binary number system three binary digit represent combination decoder chip case l decoder chip activates one eight enable signal depending content three address signal receives represent problem three line wired backwards well let take example led flasher program needed address pia could turn led pia connected second k memory block enable line coming l decoder select second memory block mpu place digit line aa three address line wired backwards decoder would see instead would select wrong memory chunk discovered problem monitoring decoder memory enable line logic probe logic probe simply tell whether signal line high low strange reason second memory block never accessed fourth thought realized binary number representation exact opposite ran upstairs get reference book sure enough decoder getting signal reverse order went back upstairs fixed problem one big advantage wire wrapping mistake easily fixed unwrap wire three signal line rewrapped took minute plugged eprom back socket poof led flashing true complicated computer nt look like much christmas tree knew working led flashing mpu telling flash victory got point thing started falling place within week half got everything working perfectly sure trouble got resolved modification still make enable circuit expansion bus forgot design one bus used okay yet building peripheral card computer working terminal program enable download program computer ram communication program ibm clone working within week miscellaneous problem encountered fixed include two signal serial port wired backwards one wire lcd broken expansion bus mystery mentioned pulldown resistor originally pullup resistor connecting led io port instead one originally connected like unravelling mystery plot almost every day got led flashing something new fell place started working matter software hardware done whew deal programmer point view programming nt bad get little bug drive crazy found eliminated entire project continues great learning experience usually alot fun maybe one day see name super computer know got baby purring sky limit next project going faster computer monitor full keyboard disk drive probably wo nt get right first power know computer work every problem minor inconvenience xx another file downloaded nirvananet tm temple screaming electron jeff hunter  rat head ratsnatcher  burn flag zardoz
