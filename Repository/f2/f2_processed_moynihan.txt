 soviet bugging america                    sen daniel patrick moynihan popular mechanic april soviet agent may listening personal telephone conversation involved government defense industry sensitive scientific activity good chance fact recent unclassified senate intelligence committee report counterintelligence indicates half telephone call united state made distance vulnerable interception every american right know also know reagan administration recognized threat long time far bureaucratic response piecemeal time reluctant consider background named permanent u representative united nation

communication security let u take look technical problem confronting u know two basic way voice transmitted telephone medium digital analog analog refers voice wave modulated amplified high frequency hf increased speed hundred cycle per second thousand cycle per second facilitates passage distance nevertheless analog radio wave diminish rapidly distance necessary periodically amplify boost signal either microwave relay tower repeater satellite transponder actually signal diminished frequency voice quality brought back high frequency digital transmission voice data vibration signal converted

telephony fast replaced digital telephony better translates computer language importantly high initial overhaul cost possible send thousand digital call bundle single conduit therefore expand digital capacity must ensure analog digital communication protected soviet eavesdropping second sending bundle single conduit base block introduce encryption talking place longdistance telephone call point
