 legal risk  legal exposure bb sysop insignificant even intention good mistake error judgment expose civil criminal liability due large part fact many people calling board agenda fail educate basic risk exposure increase dramatically  civil lawsuit           filing civil suit united state relatively simple inexpensive process plaintiff usually costing le latest version favorite word processing software indeed caller person belief case may find attorney willing represent  contingency fee  charging suit result money damage cost litigation defendant hand undoubtably high  right beginning unlike plaintiff attorney attorney work contingency fee insist upon paid whether win lose perhaps well case even almost case able recover attorney fee even prevail called  reasonable fee  grow thousand dollar matter week ending costing many time price entire bb equipment software moreover failure win lawsuit devastating implication business even family united state least law give wrongfully injured plaintiff right recover damage  caused  improper action limit amount recovered civil case  criminal liability             addition civil liability bb sysop encounter problem local state federal government criminal law exposure obvious example knowingly use bb store distribute copyrighted material obscene photograph child pornography stolen information encourage others may face severe penalty  perhaps even time jail legal exposure criminal case limited situation however deliberately commit criminal act authority come suspect board contains evidence necessary prove criminal case one caller may find middle trying protect effect investigation underestimate trouble caused improper caller conduct four year ago federal agent local authority raided board twelve city around country part something federal government named  operation sun devil  agent conducting search carried warrant gave right seize computer equipment attempt locate  hacker  believed exchanging stolen credit card number use computer bulletin board system agent searched home business confiscated computer peripheral equipment monitor printer one conviction relating computer crime far agent yet return equipment  major issue suggestion  good news risk board face minimized take active approach problem first step familiarize type claim may brought may involve board proceed knowledge mind  negligence         negligence action common type civil claim brought united state heart negligence claim legal concept  duty  duty standard law judge defendant conduct plaintiff harmed  duty  sysop expose liability violate duty caller others create  unreasonable risk  cause harm may held liable negligence required pay money damage compensation like bb technology bb law quite new  duty  applicable bb sysops  unreasonable risk  caller may face well established general absence legislation subject judge decide legal duty system operator toward caller making type decision judge consider cost imposing specific duty upon sysop comparison benefit imposing duty favor caller others may affected bb absence case subject judge simply make decision based upon believe reasonable light fact simply way knowing specific duty plaintiff might claim breached therefore easy way protecting mean must consider carefully possible legal duty judge may one day place upon bb system operator doubt lawyer someday argue sysop legal duty scan virus process electronic mail way prevents destroyed unreasonably delayed protect caller password doubt potential duty bb sysops required meet case accused violating legal duty jury could asked decide failure meet duty caused defendant harm jurisdiction allows plaintiff may able claim virus destroyed important business record misdelivered mail caused important meeting missed damage loses could extremely costly simple easy way avoid negligence claim however legal  disclaimer  help disclaimer statement give notice caller intend held responsible specific harm may occur use bb example might explain caller electronic mail may accidentally lost destroyed liable harm may come accident disclaimer properly made quite effective limiting liability case filed defendant often dismissed early strength well written disclaimer best disclaimer clearly describe specific risk caller may face state caller bear risk injury admittedly law area vague also way knowing sure specific duty law likely place upon rarely ever certainty particular disclaimer upheld court indeed even fact charge caller access may provide defense negligence claim following suggestion consider tell caller role sysop sure follow commitment caller give user fair notice decide change policy keep copious record board formal policy including change made problem may enforcing rule discover caller violating rule record detail happened put record safe place law suit sometimes filed long event happens three month later might otherwise remember incident put bb disclaimer prominent location consider using capital andor bold letter emphasize risk harm caller may face using board get form affirmative act caller indicates read disclaimer  useful someday ever need show caller aware term paper caller point proceed screen acknowledges read disclaimer agrees ideal world bb software would create log event store permanently recognize disclaim certain legal duty put much faith disclaimer  never sure legally enforceable consider disclaimer additional protection first line defense finally factual situation arises potential harm caller react promptly take control situation think bb extension home caller guest believe something someone may expose caller  unreasonable risk  harm loss recognize fact could ultimately liable  breach contract             another common type civil suit one based upon contract law many way breach contract case similar negligence case indeed often plaintiff allege breach contract negligence claim suit contrary may think general requirement contract signed writing one requirement every contract however  consideration  generally held liable contract action unless somehow agreed something caller caller agreed corresponding obligation something note sysop asks nothing caller unlikely faced contract claim situation caller claim provided sysop  consideration  sufficient create contract one way sysop reduce legal liability therefore run  free  board open anyone wish use many sysops recognize liability may attach enter contractual relationship caller order avoid ask  donation  instead payment aware however grant access special area bb  donating  member provide special service may creating contract situation give access restricted area return donation fact payment called  donation  prevent  consideration  sufficient support creation contract aware also consideration form money way illustration consider fact many board uploaddownload ratio whereby caller download privilege set proportionally number amount data uploads board good argument made caller uploaded data constitutes legal consideration contract sysop sysop bb receives benefit uploaded data return caller right receive downloaded data caller contractual relationship important recognize obligation toward caller example tell caller mail dropped board uploaded network least four time day surprised user come rely upon representation begin consider part service contractually agreed provide accept payment caller month bb access obligation see board fact remains open month noted one way avoid liability avoid entering contractual arrangement caller better approach however deliberately enter contractual relationship caller specific obligation assume benefit expect caller provide stating front rule govern use board obligation willing take making clear caller rule condition using board create  consideration  necessary make contract example one possible caller contract found syslaw book mentioned introduction magic formula however creating formal caller contract investing bb call around take look sysops require caller minimum  caller contract  include statement recognizing bb receives tangible benefit caller remember consideration must run two direction valid contract exist caller provide payment sufficient charge caller creative stating board receives charge caller caller  participation  board may sufficient indication caller must comply rule bb condition using board statement rule may changed sysop feel necessary provision caller question agreement answered sysop change agreement made necessary description bb various service area including statement indicating may changed sysop discretion see special provision regarding  adult  area cost caller using system including  uploaddownload  ratio requirement statement regarding electronic mail treated see indication law governing dispute law place bb located opposed law place caller located notice reserve right shut bb refund payment made caller well provision giving notice caller reserve right ban caller violating board rule deem necessary creating caller contract keep mind plain language caller understand far better  legalese  caller incapable understanding language agreement possible agreement would enforced favor ever need rely upon  virus       virus present one wellknown problem facing online community program often written produce unexpected disastrous result unwary user erasing user hard drive hiding virus inside program uploading contaminated program bb favorite way spreading computer virus fortunately program search eliminate computer virus many bb sysops provide service caller basic virus scanning service allows caller exchange program degree protection scanning virus probably good idea many caller expect possible law could hold duty good idea however misrepresenting caller extent done protect program virus often written goal avoiding detection always degree risk scanning may fail upfront caller possibility protect consider following suggestion scan virus regularly post program general use undergone virus scan assume commercially produced program program distributed cd rom virusfree let caller know guarantee program board safe disclose prominently risk virus scanning program use may miss something harmful unwilling unable scan virus make fact clearly known include contract caller  public message defamation                   defamation false statement made publicly effect harming another reputation sometimes defamation referred  libel   slander  first amendment u constitution guarantee right individual say almost anything desire first amendment always protect speaker held liable harm caused speech thus person whose reputation wrongly injured may bring suit  publish  statement even  publisher  original speaker note  publisher   print  defamation example radio television station sued  publishing  defamatory statement may surprised find defendant sued defamation even statement made defendant reported form accurate quotation another word put slightly different way accurate  republication  defamatory statement may create liability republisher several defense publisher statement may plaintiff claiming defamation example u constitution protects publisher law suit  public figure  certain extent deliberately become  public figure  may sue defamation able show defendant published statement actual knowledge statement false  reckless disregard  whether false constitutional defense protects defendant sued famous people thing said reasonably believed speaker true notice defendant make defamatory statement someone  public figure  get constitutional protection word liable making false statement private person even believed statement true made obviously must careful  publish  board anyone whose reputation might harmed important defense  publisher  may simple namecalling defamatory general rule even offensive statement thought bring actual harm person reputation defendant show statement alleged defamatory truthful also prevail defamation suit defamation definition untrue statement another useful rule keep mind dead defamed least jurisdiction many defense savvy sysop however rely upon legal defense protect defamation suit may cost nearly much defend defamation suit would settle case caller third person far better prevent becoming legal target first place order protect defamation claim fact consider suggestion think carefully two type defamation risk face sysop act risk may directly defame caller person either deliberate carelessly made statement republish defamatory statement initially made one caller someone else passing false rumor amount actionable defamation actively discourage caller  flaming  one another public message area caller take great pride using sharp wit make others look stupid comment quickly deteriorate personal attack personal attack quickly deteriorate libel keep mind caller may say caller may using alias mean must particularly careful posting public notice banned caller name  uploading child pornography  may seem like perfectly reasonable thing announce system bulletin turn person named never logged onto board imposter real culprit handling sensitive matter discretion always best advice  email privacy ecpa                unlike public message caller send email specific individual expect message publicized read anyone intended recipient many sysops concerned however without monitoring caller email sure user violating law exposing board legal risk faced sysops operation sun devil raid make policy bb involving electronic mail aware federal legislation called electronic communication privacy act  ecpa  ecpa federal law governs electronic mail state ecpa bb communication protected federal wiretapping law bb caller statutory right expect electronic mail intercepted read others mean bb sysop federally mandated obligation keep caller communication private sender intended recipient may make message public good news ecpa mandate higher level protection caller authority want search bb evidence criminal activity ecpa existence private electronic mail board authority theoretically limited ecpa type search may lawfully
