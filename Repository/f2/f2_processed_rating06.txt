demigodslegends lore                 really like deity demigod modification would treat god world given rather going new avatar stuff nt like book give stats god being supposed powerful give non characteristic deity demigod rocked except noticeable bare spot demihumans section laid pretty much everything needed know deity afraid ask description legend lore good giving lot idea adventure cultural background etc research good make pantheon selfconsistent completely historically accurate much detail god motif history hero legendary item plus drawing beautiful goddess  drool drool hey junior high school  missed st print regret still like better l l added dimension roleplaying nt previously covered needed fiend folio tome         added whole slew interesting monster great new monster great illustration throughout monster good description history well typeset nice font complete monster table back nice fiend folio big disappointment came far many monster feel  one shot  monster else plain stupid think ff good mm lot good le good monster would preferred better picture preferrably colour monster ff mmii start looking little unbelievable unearthed arcanum         new magic item spell ua waste totally munchkin worth money ua  many mistake enough new done nd edition point unearthed arcanum added muchneeded addons game nothing else weapon cantrips list book worth whatever find unbalanced game long term value treasure table unearthed arcanum weapon specialization barbarian greatest invention could think time today disdain weapon specialization  ua energized campaign first many rule adopted later played havoc campaign turning monty haul hell player loved new class spell power  dm hated power munchkinism worst crap reused material dragon magazine friend already  cavalier barbarian spell etc even reused art also bad planning placing material gm player book  one player borrow look barbarian easily read philospher stone player supposed use reference game magic item stats grrr  though many claim information book munchkinish got great deal use book particular new spell nt believe barbarian cavalier exist except roleplayed fighter type paladin subclass fighter acrobat cool though cool cantrips new magic goody lotta fun add new element game open abuse nt like barbarian compared one featured dragon magazine nt seen anyone try thiefacrobat thief use cavalier something liked ua ca nt remember nice spell nice class barbarian thiefacrobat underdark race strong normal campaign immunity illusion duergar svirfneblin nice item powerful item eg wand force monster manual ii         enough worthwhile monster crap recycled monster module dragon magazine artwork awful think new monster liked book modulesdragons anyway  material taken  expedition barrier peak   lost cavern tsojcanth  neat module shame reusing sold great book helped lot expanding ad world almost useless good monster dungeoneer survival guide              survival guide make decent job making average allnight urban player aware peril nature dsg would gotten lower mark except introduced concept nwp stuff poorly thought poorly researched lot good stuff little really essential wilderness survival guide             little use book except roll weather condition think dsg wsg good information handle outdoor climate etc using weather system use equipment price nearly enough manual plane           manual plane introduce new playing field lacking lot description interesting confusing nt give enough information different race terrain plane although nt got planescape heard sound better fun book provided lot adventure idea locale slaver series module                concept behind scourge slave lord excellent one module seen force player roleplay rather rely hack slash bad tsr nt make like anymore dungeon slave lord great idea fun module many time slaver module cool idea cool used many different time supermodule sort useless  tsr could easily reprinted original module gave higher rating average separate module superb  value money  one series run excellent scream  gary gygax  ok forgive x lodestone seeing hallway full boggles decimate party item list wonderland ex series module                dungeonland land beyond magic mirror fun play though stupid cool incorporated greyhawk ruin way gygax intended player pissed hated stuff put stay alive much finally got back home found need mad hatter tea revive wizard guarding portal hell affected strange poisonlike gas somehow escaped portal instead decided would rather seek make bargain lich find way close portal good intimidation could never get play second module ex  threatened would get group go movie without even resembled anything like far ex ex go feeling either love em hate em depending  serious  like campaign like makesensekindofworld dungeonland interesting way gygax adapted lewis carol character ad stats bloodstone h series module                 miracle obtained entire h series say one entertaining series module ive seen precious module allow play character reached higher level one tsr best series module rate gdq  better mine bloodstone h bit much bloodstone adventure cool theory original battlesystem rule sucked system let group archer fire total arrow single individual determine hit one die roll suck hilarious may try one new battlesystem nd edition rule see go nt played rule yet hope improvement  hh depend much roleplaying player dm judge h really read time bloodstone far killer series ever yet run session nt end character fatality per session thank goodness rod ressurection series h best actual  dungeon crawling  least amount battlesystem call munchkin got soft spot h  high level adventure chance run th level character neat hard puzzle really nasty guy end want depose everything good module need dont actually take seriously series module          love wight tomb lizard king original ravenloft ravenloft ii great innovative especially simulplay option module ravager good showing effect aging showed imagination hard work put truly classic sum better part referring spellbook curse strong played together rate ii tale outer plane op                fine little adventure really goofy one especially low level one tale outer plane nice tongueincheek look plane mean bar run santa scenario nt bad either especially liked first one involving hecate enki h accidental deletia  end
