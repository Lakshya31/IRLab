yellow green viewed without refocusing cyan blue easily viewed time red avoid frequent refocusing visual fatigue extreme color pair red blue yellow purple avoided however desaturating spectrally extreme color reduce need refocusing pure blue avoided text thin line small shape visual system set detailed sharp shortwavelength stimulus however blue make good background color perceived clearly periphery visual field fact due eye reduced sensitivity blue raster scan pattern blue background display le visible background color used avoid adjacent color differing amount blue edge differing
