personnel united state government policy requires classified information given individual unless required clearance need information performance job  sensitive unclassified information clearance required therefore access based solely need toknow policy must enforced information contained within oa system well information therefore information contained oa system must protected compromise unauthorized modification destruction current office automation system processing classified sensitive unclassified information provide sufficient hardwaresoftware security control prevent user accessing information stored anywhere system simply put current oa system based microprocessor support multiple hardware state almost case multiple hardware state necessary identify user limit action keep accessing information authorized see section  document detailed discussion problem  bracketed number correspond reference p fact time writing office automation system certified meeting even class c requirement listed department defense trusted computer system evaluation criterion hereafter known tcsec lack adequate hardwaresoftware security proper physical procedural personnel access control must used prevent personnel accessing system contains information either memory resident medium authorized  sensitivity level magnetic medium information contained volume magnetic storage medium considered sensitivity level sensitivity level least restrictive highest sensitivity level information contained medium reason requirement simple ordinary circumstance user oa system way knowing exactly written volume medium possible error made writing disk result part various file combined without user knowledge example magnetic disk file allocation table entry pointing disk file stored compromise data occur crosslink entry file allocation table one file actually point part another file file accessed modified often possible write entire file contiguous set storage location therefore file becomes fragmented disk used fragmented file become greater probability crosslink order guard compromise information due cross link information disk considered sensitivity also likely classified sensitive unclassified information  deleted  system still resident medium unless completely written approved manner see reference guidance overwriting medium therefore medium information medium regarded single sensitivity level certainly permissible information volume magnetic medium actually le sensitive sensitivity level volume however due fact impossible average user oa system tell exactly written security dictate information treated higher sensitivity level example suppose floppy disk marked  personnel privileged information  file disk contains unsensitive information general schedule salary table unsensitive file sensitive disk must treated sensitive bad pointer problem could cause file actually contain sensitive information file copied another floppy disk unless second floppy disk also considered sensitive due possibility  personnel privileged information  unintentionally copied file believed unsensitive stored sensitive disk permissible copy file printed manually reviewed determined unsensitive paper copy treated unsensitive however disk still considered sensitive applies classified information much sensitive unclassified information  oa system fixed medium v oa system removable medium  removable medium  magnetic storage medium meant frequently easily removed oa system user example removable medium include floppy disk cassette tape removable hard disk  fixed medium  magnetic storage medium meant removed system user example fixed medium include fixed disk nonvolatile memory expansion board oa system removablemediaonly one meet following criterion system currently use fixed medium eg winchester disk store process information removable medium floppy disk cassette tape oa system must volatile memory determining whether oa system contains fixed medium readonly memory rom system contains ignored either condition met system regarded containing fixed medium sensitivity level oa system removablemediaonly easily changed classified sensitive unclassified information removed system use true oa system fixed medium  sensitivity level system lowered without great deal effort virtually impossible remove classified sensitive unclassified information system therefore desired oa system used process information several different sensitivity level used personnel different level clearance oa system removablemediaonly used see section   guideline guidance changing sensitivity level oa system part ii guidance office automation system user  responsibility oa system user one common problem information security determining exactly responsible particularly important issue office automation system involved since much le opportunity oversight  average user   professional security people  therefore incumbent upon person part prevent compromise information  average user  office automation system important person maintaining oa system security security maintained user must develop  security mindset  view following general responsibility oa system user described remembered responsibility discussed section apply equally user oa system regardless whether person formally designated security officer oa system user oa system

known violation security officer user use software obtained without ensuring first thoroughly tested environment operational information compromised damaged  operational security standalone office automation system  system removablemediaonly  physical access system medium physical access oa system given time limited clearance needtoknow information contained system may necessary keep oa system separate room part room keep unauthorized personnel able read information displayed screen printer oa system protected area special care taken ensure unauthorized personnel gain access sensitive unclassified classified information example kelly charge office personnel affair must process quarterly promotion list contains personnel information must protected privacy act oa system must work however located middle office several people authorized see information see kelly therefore take care ensure none coworkers see information processing one way might use partition surround oa system block view employee second way position crt screen printer way one else office see ensure one watching third way make sure room empty work important emphasize rule also apply personnel performing maintenance oa system maintenance regardless whether preventive corrective done authorized person maintenance personnel allowed physical access oa system classified sensitive unclassified information clearance needtoknow removed  using standalone oa system removable medium  normal operation following procedure followed time normal operation oa system monitor screen printer device produce humanreadable output placed away door window help ensure casual passersby read information  never leave oa system running unattended contains information seen everyone physical access especially leave oa system unattended classified sensitive unclassified information displayed screen user must leave oa system heshe follow procedure outlined section  guideline example suppose tom edits large data file containing personnel record oa system finished save edited file since writing new file old one take time tom leaf oa system run errand sue see oa system unattended access modifies personnel file destroying integrity electronic label attached oa system information magnetic storage medium trusted accurate unless oa system evaluated national computer security center found b higher trusted system good practice indicate apparent sensitivity information electronic label sort eg character string file name directory name value first byte file label trusted accurate therefore data medium treated single sensitivity level  indicated physical label attached medium normally permissible classified sensitive unclassified volume magnetic storage medium line time volume lower sensitivity level unless sensitivity level latter volume immediately raised exception discussed section  example suppose terry file belief contain unclassified information stored top secret floppy disk terry therefore copy file unclassified disk previously unclassified disk become top secret reason way user determine exactly written onto disk chance error caused top secret information written onto disk printer left unattended classified sensitive unclassified information printed unless area located provides level physical security adequate protect printout read copied stolen unauthorized individual user print classified sensitive unclassified information remove printout printer andor printer area earliest possible time done classified sensitive unclassified information could compromised unauthorized person reading copying stealing printout note particularly true printer shared andor collocated rest oa system even adequate physical security provided good practice remove printout printer area earliest possible time example suppose pat john supervisor print john personnel record printer pat leaf printout next printer leaf room attend meeting pat gone john coworker george walk room notice printout

access system restricted authorized access data currently stored system addition user authorized access data stored system since system last declassified see reference declassification procedure  using standalone oa system fixed medium  normal operation normal operation standalone oa system fixed medium recommendation given section  apply operation oa system removable medium still applicable however additional vulnerability exist oa system containing fixed medium therefore additional precaution must taken even though one user directly access system time likely information originated one user stored fixed medium access classified information user possessing clearance needtoknow violation executive order access certain type sensitive unclassified information contrary provision section privacy act system meet requirement least class c provide assurance protection information anyone gain physical access system therefore oa system evaluated found class c higher system guideline detailed reference apply otherwise user proper clearance needtoknow data stored processed system removable medium placed oa system automatically acquires sensitivity level system however original sensitivity level removable medium restrictive oa system oa system fixed medium acquire restrictive sensitivity level marked example suppose oa system one fixed disk one floppy disk drive system fixed disk classified secret previously unclass ified floppy disk placed system floppy disk drive becomes classified secret top secret floppy disk placed floppy disk drive however entire oa system fixed disk become classified top secret normally permissible copy file classified sensitive unclassified volume removable storage medium volume fixed medium lower sensitivity level unless sensitivity level fixed medium entire oa system immediately raised level removable medium exception discussed section  example suppose file apparently unclassified yet currently resides top secret diskette file copied unclassified fixed disk sensitivity level previously unclassified disk top secret reason requirement way sure exactly copied therefore must assume worst case top secret information may inadvertently copied onto winchester disk therefore sensitivity level previously unclassified disk raised furthermore permissible copy file classified sensitive unclassified volume fixed medium volume removable medium lower sensitivity occur sensitivity removable medium immediately raised information individual user wish protect user oa system stored removable medium removable medium appropriately protected use recommendation stem fact oa system meet tcsec requirement least class c prevent system user gaining access location system memory include location hardwaresoftware control stored information removed system along medium resides however accessed others however user careful quite often information left fixed medium form scratch file backup file user make sure medium remove oa system properly secured example floppy disk removed locked away left lying top desk put unlocked container one condition security adequate physical protection must provided information vulnerable  changing sensitivity level information oa system processing permissible lower sensitivity level oa system unless declassified using procedure described reference unless oa system meet requirement least class b evaluated tcsec used process multiple sensitivity level information simultaneously case permissible change sensitivity level information oa system processing information processed oa system must regarded sensitivity level system regardless apparent sensitivity  preparing downgraded extract instance may necessary copy information volume medium one sensitivity level another volume lower sensitivity level eg copy file secret disk unclassified disk done following procedure set security officer user contact adpsso specific guidance preparing downgraded extract classified sensitive unclassified information  user finished using oa system classified sensitive unclassified file stored fixed medium user system able access removed system  first copy file volume removable medium remove information contained file fixed medium overwriting location contained file pattern eg zero one random pattern  software used overwrite trusted level commensurate oa system level sensitivity  end shift see section  safeguard described equally applicable oa system fixed medium addition oa system physically secured way room containing oa system approved open storage classified information highest level information contained oa system may sufficient secure room appropriate manner room approved open storage classified information oa system secured locking approved cabinet  operational security connected office automation system note addition guidance given section guidance given chapter guideline also applicable followed whenever oa system used  using oa system terminal connected another automated information system oa system used terminal normal rule connecting terminal ai apply example rule include never leaving oa system unattended connected another ai unless software locking mechanism used prevents anyone passing authentication check interacting remote ai  office automation system versus  dumb terminal  office automation system used terminal cause security problem occur  dumb terminal  ie programmable used among possibility malicious communication software oa system ability oa system store thing password user oa system wary untested communication software organization owning oa system take step practicable ensure communication software used system exactly documentation claim nothing else general least one copy software tested either someone within organization someone outside organization adequately test software communication software used contains malicious code communication software cause information including user password compromised corrupt information flowing oa system ai cause service denied completely worse still much without knowledge person using software therefore important use communication software package approved use responsible security officer circumstance user password remote ai ever stored oa system may seem convenient program oa system execute login routine mainframe computer system important remember oa system also execute routine someone else result another user oa system logged remote ai example suppose janet program personal computer communicating ai called mainframe press control break key time pc sends useridentifier password mainframe word pc executes janet login routine mainframe thus save keystroke involved typing information time log nt even remember password problem occurs pat see janet decides take advantage  userfriendliness  joe around pat simply connects janet pc mainframe press control break key simultaneously logged onto mainframe janet happens way prevent compromise information since mainframe way knowing really janet end terminal summary storing password oa system writing piece paper  anyone ever find security provided password defeated  consequence removable medium v fixed medium sensitivity level oa system fixed medium easily changed difficult use one system terminal wide variety ai particularly remote ai processing information different sensitivity level therefore oa system fixed medium connected ai processing classified information oa system considered classified connected later time terminal ai approved process information classified higher
