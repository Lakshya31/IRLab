column get pattern damage found assume group professional linked mcveigh got professional go inside building set real charge allowing mcveigh think job alone case fbi would come figure five minute mcveigh dupe real damage done professional inside building absurd think professional involved figured could  pay  fbi cover bottom line fbi covering damage done charge set inside building indeed fbi got talking operation root inside government somewhere nt talking small group wacko involved tom valentine right somebody able convince fbi field worker legitimate hardworking honest agent wasting time following anything beyond truck bomb jon rappoport people understand pointed people certain direction said  go look  lowerlevel investigator say  yes sir  happened somebody level fbi inside government managing investigation may ultimately link outside government go high information come confirmation thesis  middle level  level execution bombing people begin show coverup agency federal government denying prior knowledge witness excluded fbi especially reference existence john doe seen defecting grand juror oklahoma city hoppy heidelberg nt like way grand jury conducted reference existence john doe reason heidelberg went public complaint possibly breaking law felt existence john doe completely excluded testimony heidelberg suspected many john doe would prove government informant government agent   handler  mcveigh ultimately grand jury never took question john doe man sketch witness never called testify saw john doe one man mike morose gave interview channel

federal agent maybe batf attempting ensnare mcveigh  sting  operation went haywire consequence would able convince others help cover instead cn  see also thesis put forward debra von trapp still refuted yet strangely ignored people von trapp told one  fed  disinformation simple reason already inside alleged operation described jon rappoport pretty easy unfortunately say agent  bunch nut running around say bomb inside building ridiculous course looking evidence truck bomb want focus  lowerlevel federal official would buy david hall another oklahoma city bombing researcher done excellent research belief sort sting operation went awry point hall part company believe order create damage done bombing carefully placed charge inside column structure therefore idea  sting  seems fail could buy argument mcveigh leading intended bust become famous beloved america foiling mcveigh intended terrorist act however involvement professional really went seems exceed boundary simple  sting  operation tom valentine agree tough one get around hard one lot people face jon rappoport look happened hoppy heidelberg guy went grand jury juror handbook spelled juror right got frustrated
