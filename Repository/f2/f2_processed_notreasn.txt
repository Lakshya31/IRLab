constitution kind pledge whole people support constitution even pledge one following consideration show nature thing act voting could bind nobody actual voter owing property qualification required probable first twenty thirty year constitution onetenth fifteenth perhaps twentieth whole population black white men woman minor permitted vote consequently far voting concerned onetenth fifteenth

support constitution recent year since number voter election usually fluctuated onethird twofifths populace said voting man pledge support constitution unless act voting perfectly voluntary one part yet act voting properly called voluntary one part large number vote rather measure necessity imposed upon others one choice point repeat said former number viz  truth case individual actual voting taken proof consent even time contrary considered without consent even asked man find environed government resist government force pay money render service forego exercise many natural right peril weighty punishment see men practice tyranny use ballot see use ballot chance relieving tyranny others subjecting short find without consent situated use ballot may become master use must become slave alternative two self defence attempt former case analogous man forced battle must either kill others killed save life battle man take life opponent inferred battle one choosing neither contest ballot

forced others mean selfdefence offered matter necessity used one left  doubtless miserable men oppressive government world allowed ballot would use could see chance thereby meliorating condition would therefore legitimate inference government crush one voluntarily set even consented  therefore man voting constitution united state taken evidence ever freely assented constitution even time consequently proof large portion even actual voter united state ever really voluntarily consented constitution even time ever proof every man left perfectly free consent without thereby subjecting property disturbed injured others  legal knowledge vote choice necessity thus forced upon legal knowledge particular individual voted choice consequently voting consented pledged support government legally speaking therefore act voting utterly fails pledge one support government utterly fails prove government rest upon voluntary support anybody general principle law reason said government
