frequency operation performed within certain class computer example mac processor higher frequency higher frequency operation processed faster computer provided speed effecting hardware like cache slow data path designer computer apple case use component rated frequency faster final computer made motorola generally alike alike fast motorola sell several processor rated mhz mac accelerator large frequency difference require different mask production processor small change may motorola need guarantee chip mark mhz function properly mhz variety condition chip vendor test part different frequency sort chip accordingly others may label sell chip different price long within spec possible actually come batch separated demand tested make sure withstand frequency possible mhz processor function fine higher frequency say mhz running faster however generate heat many component computer need synchronized frequency generated crystal oscillator synchronize part like nubus card video frequency may separate crystal oscillator typical computer may several crystal oscillator clock different group component motherboard provided component clocked particular crystal oscillator capable speed increase crystal oscillator may replaced one higher frequency much specific mac sped method depends motherboard designed component used thing crystal oscillator control processor also control newer mac mhz difference top speed reported model part luck draw crystal oscillator swapping done year early computer even jumper made really easy disable one oscillator enable another higher frequency one first mac modified iisi stock iisi run mhz iici mhz since architecture machine similar seemed reasonable run iisi iici speed another important factor earlier mac one crystal oscillator

crystal oscillator motherboard mac put new one instead putting one straight onto board nice use socket test individual mac see cutoff frequency always put original oscillator back socket first find crystal oscillator referring previous table description physical characteristic careful remove oscillator people use normal soldering iron fine grounded three prong soldering iron would bit safer use copper wick soak solder four pin pop proper oscillator board multilayer careful damage anything gentle recently one report guy damaged iisi board incident ever heard lot lot people done use  desoldering iron  melt solder pump suck solder swirl pin oscillator around get solder done done good job oscillator pop access one desoldering iron highly suggest use cleaner job le risk burning discoloring board next take pin ic socket remove pin  solder board see modification digikey part number make sure put pin go pin    notch socket face way dot old oscillator facing put faster oscillator done iisi highest frequency could get work without problem mhz thus speed increase mhz actual crystal mhz double frequency ttl mhz crystal oscillator exist rare thing people seem get cmos

stick mhz case iisi come heatsink reduce heat processor get small heat sink attach cool heat sink surface area faster heat dissipated careful put heat sink typically use heat transfer grease heat sink slide mac moved heat sink might short something best thing seems get heat sink hole middle drill one use heat transfer grease also put small drop super glue hole heat sink onto chip put drop side hold

use c c cav q q qav q qav pm pm pm really neat thing came play february apple released centris quadra machine since apple using surface mount crystal oscillator apple using surface mount crystal oscillator plenty accessible area metal tab oscillator june  guy kuo reported first crystal swap sort centris net soldered pin pin socket directly onto surface mount crystal oscillator pin ttl type crystal oscillator position made jumper pin    disabled onboard surface mount crystal oscillator jumper  put new crystal socket file also available sumex info macinfohdwr centrisclockmod little hesitant soldering onto new quadra wrote day later using surface mount test clip asked thought suspected could find reasonable test clip otherwise believed would work day later surface mount test clip arrived test clip worked perfectly running quadra mhz problem best modification contained simple little clip could removed without trace thus removable test clip approach born q even worked mhz long access serial port day later got several crystal found highest frequency quadra mhz since tried mhz serial port work cutoff q mhz never use serial port mhz worked fine mhz mac happy would boot still interested need surface mount test clip pomona make prefer one make sure get surface mount test clip ic test clip also work prefer surface mount soic small outline integrated circuit one pin clip fine say go narrow wide pin part nd  pin part nd  part number one alloy lead used recommend gold coated one resistancecorrosion effect minimal also need pin ic socket plenty type machined pin one nice pop pin needed get way since need three pin socket pin ic socket wtin pin part ed  also need oscillator later little wire soldering iron solder possibly heat sink depending machine c cav q qav add heat sink hsnd  inch one plenty  others already heat sink get hot extra fan q removed fine heat sink come clip needed attach chip bit pain work may several way slide clip side sometimes fall half way eventually work people using heat sinkfan combo seem work fine well new q qav computer based new mask come mhz without heatsink  h    rc  mask cav qav us modification would best add heat sink put together stand clip jaw facing row pin go left right call closer row row b number pin left right pin clip next place ic socket pin notch left number pin row closest going left right row numbered go
