omnipresent  alan kay pointed year ago technology get done right nt even see like think  walk room hand go flick switch  much thought give stupid light switch hopefully little light come  telephone getting close j even better room walk light switch automatically motion detector yeah j tell fidonet said im sorta ignorant subject  weird point view course involved  tenth year end year network guess would  february march  network collection bulletin board loose confederation completely thoroughly utterly decentralized literally one top reality perception fidonets like even among people member think look like one thing particular reality filter living amongts hierarchy addict fidonet basic element bulletin board vague basic element definable set protocol let bulletin board communicate fidonet started bunch fido board running fido software later adding fidonet allows pointtopoint email equivalent plain old unix type email message user domain user fidonet unless syntax different j start single bb started system writing software phoenix software phoenix technology first employee portable m do stuff prior rom bios partly based previous work portable  m do installation three day charging exorbitant sum  delivering really good stuff people got money worth got damn fast art totally portable stuff portable attitude toward hardware wrote bulletin board sort based fidonet bulletin board network thing attached importantly social mechanism pretty obvious start going social monster almost technical thing original environment bulletin board around long time time got around fido came fido way used pretty much preexisting every one completely different run cantankerous person ran board way saw fit period one going tell one would ever occur fidonet fit environment j anarchic environment yes explicitly anarchic people ran reason separated large distance time space local fidonet explicitly anarchist start ran across old interview old documentation   saying  people didnt hear went think like anarchism mean throwing rock cop well sometimes suppose mostly cop definition j sense bomb throwing anarchist guess sort sense political disorder   specific event san francisco union labor bust blackmail  guy tom mooney planted bomb bomb went said  tom mooney damn anarchist  like american socialist even commie big american socialism turn century let air sail big labor stuff j anarchy sorta bad connotation anarchy unlike many seem want embrace think libertarian philosophy fairly anarchic find widespread throughout net basically handsoff philosophy think people often take seriously like anarchist camp rule consider personal philosophy political thing nothing politics j becomes overtly political cease anarchy  yeah le nt really care considered politics personal interaction treat people treat relation people anarchism  always call paul goodman style principle people work together better cooperating theyre coerced simple nothing goddam politics treat people work fidonet based explicitly sort laid top lot fido bulletin board let talk straightforward pointtopoint manner j fido board fido time required fairly low level restructuring innards message base stuff fido pretty good bulletin board year though definitely old fashioned never done revision fido software two year j thinking thinking dropping laughter thought done fidonet started spring  two system friend john medel sp bob moore within four month twenty fifty  end year approaching next february nine month started growing really fast every single one run somebody reason manner purpose accommodate nothing unusual one sense computer network essentially run way internet central internet authority go get system internet put online find people help register nic convention handling name j sort ideally cooperative yeah quite cooperative nt really get kicked unless technically screw something massively illegal glaringly obvious likely technical like nt answer mail long time electronic thing like nt start take echomail came done guy named jeff rush dallas way talk among dallas sysops organizing pizza party fully distributed redundant database using fidonet netmail record database literally equivalent newsgroup gate back forth easily find hard talk openendedly fidonet without really knowing  j link fidonet easily internet uucp mail gateway set ufgate package  know totally different paradigm ip internet stuff fully connected time want connect system finland rub packet come back generally second fidonet stored forward offline processing  j big short  system j wow lot  doubled year  think doubled year doubling every year long time laugh j lot discussion today encryption scheme involved actually yeah user routinely j using pgp yeah fidonet pretty intentionally involved getting pgp ubiquitous first time around  intentionally consciously quick dump  copy week starting monday sure unstoppable spread quickly kind argument whether legal whether going incriminate use pgp traffic network  j would nt criminal issue  people believe kind crazy nonsense j somebody patent algorithm yeah afraid send encrypted data police bust house steal computer kind stuff  thing fidonet sprung fullyformed seeming nowhere rest computer world people internet access school industry went school got job maintained internet  brought sort internethood j think changing bit  oh changing continue change someday incomprehensible way today sort fidonet come direction came  hopefully professional white guy could afford computer best tradition radio astronomy amateur truly called amateur network professional way  professional way  profession  professional frequently used mean legitimate opposed amateur  j mean  hobbyist  yeah amateur word become disparaging mean actually older sense like radio amateur sense nt money done sake never traditional kind connectivity also nt corporate culture nt computer network culture basically formed dark j speaking word  culture  find within fidonet universe particular set cultural predilection tend general kind group community us fidonet well like thing really subjective yeah seem travel internet fidonet distinct flavor one better tell internet people say  oh flame level fidonet awful  bullshit flame level internet high loftier language five line signature kind crap  sorry better different le alien comfortable  viceversa fidonet

pay phone bill j people argue ca nt strictly online community others believe feel kind facetoface interaction internet much began become broadly accessible regular people  internet still completely thoroughly inaccessible  sorry simply accessible large amount hardware intimate relationship someone like go school something otherwise paying money  people fall crack  j public access internet yeah terminal u average person could walk figure use le week would surprised still take huge amount specialized knowledge relatively speaking easy get  j technical side fairly dense  oh yeah  do hacker hardware hacker fifteen fucking year twenty year unix intimidating arbitrarily difficult use  lot user macho attitude  well plow  whole priesthood nonsense know stupid discussion argument whether could online culture aint gon na get decided either gon na get done done think online community people nt asking  online community  going business tangible enough really get documented except

endtoend line cord phone wall jack system together mean entry level lot lower functional hell mean work great nt really much slower  speed anyway second millisecond difference j link network strictly email stuff file transfer  oh lot file transfer stuff matter fact lot sophisticated ftp stuff user point view thing called sdn software distribution network look like conference file object message object file theyre stored redundant manner locally concentrated far away scattered kind nebulous like network thing monthly announcement new product shareware actually shareware free thing like file patch file request send message say  oh way file  nt problem lot older network seven bit channel crap eight bit channel bit crcs run alien system problem  ascii character set v cyrillic alphabet kinda stuff problem chaotic anywhere else j remote login storeandforward mail system essentially thing remote login  system fidonet radically different radio shack color computer cpm machine apple ii giant do machine giant lan unix box running common protocol far broader hardware base even unix box unified operating system set protocol different mailer fidonet interface bulletin board look completely different much higher level abstraction fidonet get defined lot  like internet safe say almost everything unix day huge proportion unix  j certainly need kind standard interoperable extent internet nt real compatibility tcpip layer rock solid thing common rlogin telnet ftp stuff user paradigm rather set protocol well fine wonderful love put real crimp style seen os interfaced ftp j nt  oh really

screen  good job ed cavazos almostattorney viceprez effaustin show settle listen conversation continues lot fidonet radically different ca nt get people either hear understand going like others intentionally made like others really basic principle seem random intentional  writing writing seven year strictly american anarchist principle based written policy document actually    attempted takeover corporation formed within like cancer became giant boil surface called ifna international fidonet association sort good idea potentially good idea started node level time got around implemented world utterly changed people run like club u white guy computer node level european definitely obviously growing hopped puddle system appearing south america scattered know go  get one get two four start grow starting subspecialize whole overall view naive view admittedly right middle learned  oh nt going work  corporation grew became c like thing get powerhungry get grabby territory fight fight constituent membership constituent network  actually fought killed gained control copyright trademark fought network instead dying like everyone predicted thrived j fight go fought lawyer proxy vote usual crap goddam hotel san jose final straw  j part corporation well bunch u started  first brainstorming could get  deal modem obvious stuff spokesperson fidonet attend ema meeting year represent bulletin board operator fidonet member electornic privacy thing technical trade stuff obvious thing still lacking still need established really early everyone retains control system expected part run one else run simple sound really radical act get across people nt sit butt course usual work sits butt fine fidonet little odd unlike internet domain server  say  connect toadcom  say  com okay toad  address  go fidonet appears centralized database every system net copy moment megabyte long ascii database  record updated every week contains full physical logical information entire network  phone number system name restriction use protocol supported ascii text like system name city know kind junk contains hierarchical addressing scheme network contains lot redundancy j given central authority maintains database terminology fidonet pointnode netzone point nt really part fidonet peculiar thing  node basic unit bulletin board mailer generally phone number modem net cluster fidos cluster node like san francisco net sfbay net  system node net basic social organizational unit designed small enough comprehend regular old term like know love club kind group  get big tend fragment piece become autonomous unit net collected real life geography continent north american phone system alien western european one lot alien phone system north american tend lot le political

make work who going allow somebody new jersey dictate going run system way exert kind control start getting control war spend time way node list made every net fragment make chunk node list straightforward task even though end work passed  one level twenty regional coordinator take fragment everybody get copy everybody else weekly list guy compiles giant list difference week last week mail difference back tree halved half network smashed flat would regenerate parallel nobody charge balance terror genuine balance terror responsibility power get redundancy one cut network one declare

happened recently england  bunch religious fundamentalist hammering away gained control large chunk fidonet uk started   there pervert board gon na em  laughter clipped goddam list removed entry uk list sort noticed disappeared people still communicate mail fragment handgenerated necessary node list processor let incorporate private list reply back like one cut network start thinking realize number good bad side effect like real asshole troublemaker nothing like unless somebody come pull gun something kinda hard get someone kicked le public place  well hotel would relatively easy street got ta live neighbor true fidonet learn live neighbor vice versa flaming asshole learn behave well enough utterly censured generally happens  people ignore one guy another fundamentalist christian nut case amusing actually true bible believer called prerapture something prerapture network  persecuted side loved mailing everybody gibberish page page gibberish program filter mail say nt wan na see

irritates people work people even crazy one social organism nt really like disliked widely like audience nothing else thats underpinnings  implemented pretty much way explicitly  written policy document unreadable  page boilerplate  mechanism organization flexible technically technological change opportunity come within year half net support  u robotics smartly discovered bulletin board realized way work even though relatively small number bulletin board sysops bulletin board caller look see hardware get sysop wonder  kind modem  oh must pretty good use  bad mouth hundred people basically courted fidonet said  want see modem  first courier buck new time buck offered deal dollar bargain relatively speaking wanted true flow control symmetrical modem basic command set instant success hst much industry annoyance blue g proprietary protocol asymmetrical one way baud way  came u worked handshake stuff started changing protocol side originally based xmodem amazingly similar x packet ack like kermit much efficient kermit much like uucpg windowed  block ack block ack block ack  fine baud baud good asymmetrical modem collapsed another protocol called wazoo floating around instantly became hot protocol negotiation started session could pick zmodem fullywindowed screaming run ackless could work hell hst way protocol could nt internet protocol uucpg useless word modem useless existing protocol fidonet historically flexible technologywise ed familiar john quarterman seen map fidonet nt seen map fidonet talk occassionally republished one article fido news ago  fidonews weird phenomenon   circulation weekly newsletter tenth year sort go unacknowledged  fidonet giant credibility problem sprang forth fullyformed way outside traditional computer thing work pc

worse way complicated thing developed little western history timeline take resource effort energy spread sort trickle get defined along way definitely paradigm glued base j allows distributed way organizing thing  see ever good telephone nt get much better telephone think position society like bruce said hacker crackdown notice nt one ubiquitous like light switch nt think telephone exciting object j remember single phone house big deal second phone usually line three phone line one dedicated data line dont think know many people nt least two three phone house two consider rarefied  need two line six one point bulletin board data line like oh voice line data line  j prefer asynchronous text swapping sure maybe personal idiosyncrasy seems funny matisse enzer support guy well  problem
