engineer many year experience magnetic recording never heard term  clipping level  came discussion kayfog fact never seen specification sheet box bag buy cheap stuff mail order disk purchased however spend couple year part design team winchester drive personal computer one task specification testing disk used drive clipping level since magnetic medium pretty much whether tape diskette hard disk major difference material magnetic particle bonded mylar tape diskette aluminum hard disk nt difficult guess meant  clipping level  little looking part catalog found specification chip designed use disk drive defined  clipping level  although rather vague term unfortunate word used describe test performed diskette since different widely understood meaning throughout general electronics industry

two characteristic make difference disk k disk thickness coating important subject  clipping level  uniformity coating tiny part disk size pinhole get coated signal level recoverable spot reduced thus number sufficient size level signal fairly uniform  pinhole  pass head point drop referred  dropout  industry furthermore coating thickness varies surface disk amplitude signal vary relatively smooth manner disk rotates generally serious problem however drive recover data separating disk related variation variation signal due real data provided disk related variation large typically drive might able successfully ignore disk related variation reduce amplitude real signal le normal output number however also depends wide variety factor varies drive drive even model manufacturer thus anything one could assure level disk related variation held within specified range reduce probability error key word  probability  said later therefore disk tested  clipping level  tested assure variation due disk small enough signal level never drop variation held range follows higher  clipping level  le variation signal output reduced probability disk error come tough part much extra money pay disk tested level compared one tested level would pay twice much ten time much way look high probability buy brand x disk work whatever test run probably sufficient assure brand x disk always work way knowing  clipping level  disk destined drive tested believe manufacturer floppy disk word hard disk case winchester drive situation little different manufacturer disk go drive generally different

surface improving contact performance tape recording critical application new tape never used without running machine least sometimes several time reason therefore used cheapdisks several time feel comfortable brand new long last finally really long term cheapdisks retain information stored equally well superdisks say period year well dealing real unknown disk around hundred year old magnetic recording using medium type used disk year old archival data around long period time turned problem number field ask librarian problem facing library congress protecting many book experience magnetic
