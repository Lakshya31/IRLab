eyesight standard correcting myth richard n holden phd chairman criminal justice department central missouri state university warrensburg missouri decade law enforcement agency required applicant satisfy certain eyesight requirement considered employment would challenge belief public safety officer need good eyesight many challenge success idea applicant must posse perfect uncorrected vision basic question emerges police recruit allowed compensate imperfect vision corrective lens answer  yes  much variation agency allow several factor converge make timely issue law enforcement manager consider dwindling pool suitable applicant fulfill future personnel need argue unnecessary selection requirement undermine law enforcement recruiting effort addition recent enactment american disability act ada prohibits employment discrimination basis physical disability person able perform essential function job visual impairment could constitute protected disability agency defend vision standard leave open litigation new act finally advancement medical science need considered presentday optical technology render obsolete many ageold argument favor vision requirement article explores issue involved vision standard go discus issue relate experience sentiment expressed recent survey law enforcement officer concerning eyesight requirement supporting argument necessity good vision law enforcement  corrected otherwise  rest visual nature police work law enforcement officer spend good portion working hour observing people event reporting see additionally officer must respond quickly event taking place around must interpret react action others one basic tenant vision standard significant impairment translates equally impaired ability interpret event react appropriately moreover evidence poor vision might make officer vulnerable court officer vision becomes open judgment may evidence offered based officer observation argument strict uncorrected vision standard rest belief officer may lens forcibly removed occur argument officer would unable function adequately say officer would able fire weapon accurately discern suspect armed operate police vehicle would place officer physically dangerous situation could possibly jeopardize others although argument constitute underpinning vision requirement police administrator clearly agreement necessity uncorrected vision standard study found majority police agency surveyed required minimum uncorrected standard percent responding department required vision correctable  another percent allowed uncorrected vision  differing vision standard exist otherwise similar agency large police department including new york city los angeles dallas apply restrictive standard large department  chicago detroit newark tulsa  uncorrected vision standard academic community also fails reach consensus subject argue strict standard others however question strict uncorrected vision requirement especially light evolving vision technology shatterproof plastic soft contact lens even passage ada controversy uncorrected vision standard attracted attention court although court upheld individual agency vision requirement past congruence may coming end wisconsin court ruled uncorrected vision standard violated state law prohibiting discrimination handicapped addition issue several factor fuel argument vision requirement law enforcement agency require incumbent officer maintain vision standard required recruit mean many police agency even strict uncorrected vision standard recruit employ numerous veteran officer need wear corrective lens order perform duty still despite fact little concrete data exists concerning relationship corrective lens police performance basic issue three basic issue emerge argument restrictive uncorrected vision standard first officer loses corrective lens becomes visually impaired vulnerable physical assault second officer able see sufficiently aim service weapon result may become vulnerable armed suspect third officer vision impaired operate police vehicle therefore officer could pursue fleeing suspect addition corollary issue emerges officer ability perform becomes hampered officer placed similar risk due loss support visionimpaired officer many observer within outside law enforcement offer belief sincerity however dissenting opinion exist regard first issue could argued officer engaged handtohand combat need eyeglass identify assailant range officer would nearly blind incapacitated individual uncorrected vision likely bad correctable  second vast majority shootout handgun occur close range officer killed firearm example percent shot foot le indeed nearly percent fatality resulted shootout foot le range officer point firearm rather aim therefore officer lessthanperfect vision suffer significant disadvantage range increase vision capability become important handgun accuracy diminishes drastically distance increase beyond foot regardless officer vision last regard issue visual impairment inability pursue fleeing suspect issue currently generate much debate among police administrator vehicle pursuit several department prohibit pursuit extreme circumstance department posse facility teach effective pursuit procedure addition police vehicle notoriously subject poor maintenance factor cloud argument concerning vision capability perfect vision required proper training equipment question need strict uncorrected vision requirement frame question simple term officer feel inadequate initiate vehicle pursuit whatever reason pursuit occur remains true situation involving potential pursuit currently represents standard policy majority police agency finally may argued officer lose corrective lens dutyrelated incident impaired officer perfect vision get foreign object eye chemical mace finger sand case officer corrective eyewear may actually better protected without eye covering research study lack quantifiable data regarding correlation corrective lens police performance hamper productive discussion subject reason research study recently conducted attempt clarify issue provide sufficient baseline information future debate might center upon fact rather supposition method survey method emerged logical mean determine association vision requirement police performance unfortunately police agency contacted kept relevant record area may several reason lack information one may officer wear corrective lens wish perceived weaker perfect vision therefore include information relating visionrelated incapacitation police report law enforcement agency may simply perceive loss corrective lens physical confrontation problem worth studying whatever reason agency routinely record information police database information available appeared cost agency replacement damaged lens however information failed address issue police performance immediately loss lens failing obtain agency data relating vision performance required research effort concentrate officer experience method yielded primarily anecdotal information remained viable way establishing quantifiable data regarding issue order gauge relationship vision policing effectively project focused police manager wide variety agency survey population consisted police executive across united state england australia canada attending conference fbi academy quantico virginia combined length service survey population totaled  year average  year per respondent participant asked knew case officer lost corrective lens dutyrelated incident respondent answered yes asked loss corrective lens resulted injury officer others researcher asked loss corrective lens prevented officer completing activity attempted time loss respondent asked report incident impaired vision presented problem regardless corrective lens finally researcher asked respondent offer comment police vision standard provide phone number contact result participant percent said knew incident officer lost corrective lens course duty fortyfour percent knew incident twelve respondent percent recalled incident officer sustained injury related loss corrective lens five percent reported incident loss corrective lens impaired officer performance percent recalled incident impaired vision unrelated corrective lens created problem data appear fairly straightforward easy interpret several factor actually make complex analysis comment followup telephone interview revealed misinterpretation several response questionnaire example number respondent understood question regarding injury mean wound suffered specific incident officer lost corrective lens fact intent question determine respondent knew incident loss lens directly led ensuing injury confusion occurred regard question performance misinterpretation led slightly inflated representation number case injury analyzing comment survey instrument conducting followup telephone interview slightly different picture emerged nine case respondent reported injury wound due lost corrective lens presumably would occurred anyway injury happened struggle caused officer lose lens one case subject struck officer sufficient force render unconscious force blow also broke officer glass similarly two incident initially reported failure perform adequately due lost eyewear physical confrontation officer lost corrective lens still controlled subject situation case loss lens inconvenienced officer impair performance likewise several instance officer failure complete assignment actually resulted accompanying injury rather lens loss additionally several anomaly bear mention one respondent initially reported sustained injury lost corrective lens followup interview determined vision impairment lead injury rather subject knocked pair expensive eyeglass face officer instinctively reached subject grabbed twisted arm although sustaining injury arm officer regain control subject another respondent reported officer lost lens could read license number escaping suspect vehicle however partner manage record number leading eventual arrest addition several respondent reported instance officer eyeglass became temporarily fogged exited air conditioned vehicle one respondent also reported exposure sand wind required officer contact lens take periodic break lens cleaning ultimately three reported case injury failure perform satisfied intended perimeter survey questionnaire represents percent survey sample accounting number service year represented respondent number equates case per every year one incident could verified sole verified case involved major shootout several fbi agent two heavily armed suspect exchange gunfire two agent suspect lay dead five agent sustained serious wound immediately prior shootout one agent lost glass brought automobile abrupt halt foot suspect vehicle fatally wounded ensuing gunfight fellow agent speculate loss glass significantly affected ability observe movement gunman assessment accurate loss eyewear may cited contributing factor agent death experience officer surveyed indicated officer wearing corrective lens encounter situation momentarily lose corrective lens forcibly removed however vast majority case occur arrest situation within detention facility facetoface confrontation rarely involve weapon case loss lens produced negative result either officer eventual outcome situation personal commentary respondent expressed uniform opposition uncorrected vision standard several noted agency lost number wellqualified applicant later gained employment agency following comment offered lieutenant charge training personnel department typifies observation  think one meaningless fitness standard remaining bar qualified people police service sure somewhere time officer seriously hurt maybe died eyesight issue  lost glass etc  officer fired dismissed even assignment changed diminished sight capacity hiring process standard serf eliminate otherwise qualified acceptable candidate  addition several officer offered personal account acknowledged vision problem argued performance remained unhindered several reported agency changed standard due lawsuit respondent reported agency reevaluating standard felt current requirement barred many qualified candidate conclusion mean law enforcement agency immediately eliminate policy concerning standard uncorrected vision necessarily study neither sufficiently comprehensive scientifically representative enough draw sweeping conclusion however survey type provide starting point meaningful discussion argument upon agency base uncorrected vision requirement offer little way empirical support remain based largely hypothetical argument nowhere agency documented situation studied data concerning issue point underlying problem police vision standard well area based proven capability necessary fulfill term employment instead reverse often happens lacking supporting data law enforcement agency adopt standard based   scenario process lose qualified applicant perpetuate mythbased standard questionable relationship police performance agency need perhaps survey future study
