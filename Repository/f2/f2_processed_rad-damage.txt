note radiation damage  safe level radiation exposure question safe level question great risk  karl z morgan three major theory radiation damage living tissue set physician approximation based broad assumption threshold hypothesis asserts exists safe level radiation idea behind thinking low cell repair rate order damage rate hence get resultant damage linear hypothesis theory would expect malignant cancer personrems example would find one cancerous patient exposed people rem people  rem supralinear hypothesis main result low dos get cancerspersonrem high dos saying get radiation instead get damaged surviving cell fact type ionising radiation alpha fast moving helium nucleus beta electron gamma high energy em radiation neutron highly penetrating damage occur word radiation cause cancer typical cell around mm across cell nucleus mm radiation say gamma enters body chance intersect one cell inside cell nucleus contains chromosome essentially dna helix dna look like two entwined string nucleotide amino acid c g across strand paired cg portion dna series acid called gene gene exist along chromosome contain data protein radiation happens pas cell nucleus relatively large entity compared rest cell one thing happen exposure subject cell risk order decreasing probability radiation go right thru interaction radiation irrepairable destruction cell dy radiation damage nucleus cell survives damaged state repetitively divide grows solid tumour odd year cancer radiation repairable damage cell return normal state low probability possibility one watch division dna strand stretch time cell susceptible damage also possible radiation ionise water cell cytoplasm leading formation free radical travel distance react chemically dna nucleus interfering chemical bonding along helix two type damaging interaction occur amino acid point mutation deletion substitution inversion addition b large scale mutation chromosome aberration deletion eg retinoblastoma amplification translocation also possible compound break along dna easy cell repair unlike single strand double strand break cell nuclear membrane also susceptible damage could due alteration permeabilityosmosis membrane due radiationinduced imbalance ionised particle certain threshold exceeded start saturating cell lethal threshold serf define two category radiation effect effect nature threshold dose

dose cancer stem cell one able undergo mitosis human body reached full maturity example blood cell cell lining intestine normal functioning body cell replacement balance cell loss cancer stem fails stop mitosis descendant divide uncontrolled forming tumour bit like binary tree cell multiplicity oncogene gene interfere cell division process mutation protooncogenes whose role control cell growth mitosis thought radiation promotes creation oncogene also cancersuppressing gene inhibit oncogene formation best known example rb gene inhibits retinoblastoma let add fourth idea radiation damage
