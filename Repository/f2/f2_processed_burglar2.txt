emits frequency lie human threshold hearing receiver monitor incomming frequency entire system generally self contained one unit although occasionally transmitter used several receiver sound wave emanate transmitter follow elliptical resembling elongated oval pattern ultimately return reciever wave somehow altered elliptical journey receiver know alarm sound therefore theory burglar enters guarded area ultrasonic frequency altered presence thus alerting receiver intrusion ultrasonic system effective range generally  foot although ultrasonic frequency system trasmit low  khz kilohertz thousand cycle per second standard radio khz make detection somewhat difficult impossible elimination possible ultrasound user even easier people pet excluded ultrasonic usage pet cause many false alarm ultrasound may irritating since higher sonic perception range loud noise create false alarm also ultrasound employed great deal movement blowing drape forcedair heating falling box cuckoo clock etc cause false alarm generally exclude owner ultasonic club several method ultrasonic detection multirange bug detector reveal presence alarm assistance electronics engineer one could make device responds frequency khz another way purchase multiband radio scanner contains low frequency frequency scanned slowly aforementioned parameter inordinate amount static interference occur correct frequency discovered another way albeit unorthodox take mouse hamster near suspected ultrasonic sourse observe reaction small rodent detest ultrasound usually make every effort avoid shit use electronic pestridders converter available bring inaudible frequency human audio perception level presence ultrasound converter produce highpitched hum even prior detection impossible professional burglar observed transmitter almost always placed coner protected room sensor dectected located next one penetrate invisible inaudible sound barrier order disarm without subjecting oneself immediate detection homeowner caused ultrasonic dector blare throughout neighborhood comming home work every day would soon get many complaint neighbor ultrasonic alarm alarm well delay switch allow person enter house disarm system befor alarm go allows arm leave befor begin monitoring type usually simple onoff switch back burlar reach befor thirty second expire system nt know nt homeowner type usually desktop model usually electrical let attached lamp may made come scare burglar simple onoff switch obviously easiest bypass bit difficult often disguised wall outlet hifi speaker book conspicuously

theives book type difficult locate many book room rather thich volume either two twin circle square transmitter receiver binding name alos generic nature burglar primary difficulty lie defeating outlet wall mounted type several technique used together enhance success tremendously one prior access protected area system disarmed sucess defeating system almost guaranteed burglar may lower sensitivity zero fill entire apparatus aerosol styrofoam one around cut drywall locate bare jumper wire may found one prior access still option disposal owner away one may rap window violently create alarm done daily neighbor eventually tell tired blasting neighborhood every day believing sensitivity high usually lower compensate  mysterious  outside noise done burglar wearing heavy oversiezed coat even rug possible soundabsorbing material burglar safer larger coat rug absorbs rather altar sound frequency system efficiency compromised considerably wall covered rug drapery tapestry effect multiplied absorbing sound enough addition burglar must move superslow burglar must traverse monitored area twenty foot may spend least ten minute crossing object move slowly frequency remains undisturbed burglar motion ultrasonic unit hidden behind wallpaper plaster cut effectiveness least ultrasound unit installed manner become unresponsive method becomes efficacious one last remote yet viable technique circumventing type component one discovers exact operating frequency unit theoretically least get ultrasonic transducer frequency stick front receiving unit whole monitored area could violated reciever would receiving transmitter transmitting never tried befor possibility ii photoelectric alarm photoelectric alarm  electric eye  fairly common alarm today like ultrasonic unit consists transmitter receiver transmitter sends lightto receiver beam interrupted second reciever recognizes sound alarm electric eye princple came world war ii word system old photoelectric unit may transmitter receiver oppose transmitter reciever may housed together one unit utilizing reflector end room idea kind alarm one let buzz walk store old type unit still seen place us ordinary white light simply defeated shining flashlight receiver buddy may pas right beam easily detected especially night light plainly visible even though newer model use invisible light still terribly easy bypass placed front door window long hallway attempt catch passerby inherent disadvantage photoelectric sensor easily seen although sometimes disguised wall receptacle almost always plain view fact alone aid circumvention modern electric eye use beam ultraviolet infrared light anyone buy science supply company filter allow view uv ir light invisible light visible may easily avoided trying shine beam uv ir light reciver may work highertech model use pulsed beam receiver programed transmitter frequency deviation result alarm one access premise befiorehand kick break reciever causing malfunction causing owner shunt zone arming system may case componet us laser light instead ultra violet infrared easily stepped ducked otherwise avoided provided entire network laser form impassable grid would used

hood made stuff lower chance detection iv microwave system microwave alarm system another transmitterreciever motion detector unquestionably difficult successfully bypass system emits beam ultrahigh rf radio frequency energy generally  ghz detects intruderes observing change rf energy microwave system extremely versatile one unit may used monitor room hallway primary disadvantage microwave system propensity penetrate boundary building protecting word microwave energy used guard business sometimes reach parking lot understandably cause many false alarm detection microwave actually easy frequency use ghz approximately poloice radar near microwave alarm system superheterodyne radar detector sound close resemblance microwave radar prompted people call  radar system  technically inaccuratte detected quite frankly much one bypass micro wave alarm capacity simgle component however always part larger centralized system may defeated possibility however determined burglar depend
