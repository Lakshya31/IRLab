contacting disclaimer      although unp tested several system guarantee unp without bug therefore take responsibility damage directly indirectly caused unp result known unknown error purpose unp        unp try reverse action program like pklite lzexe perform case nt know program use data compression executable file yet leave compressed file state still normally executed great want save disk space disadvantage anyone spread virus compress infected file virus invisible debugging also becomes lot difficult since code become unreadable primary reason behind writing unp could make story loadingdecompressing time probably talking th second well least dont notice delay mhz  unp expand compressed executable file also able remove kind routine program instance central point antivirus tm immunize code safely removed though removal currently limited routine future ability might greatly expanded requirement       run unp need least microprocessor however want take full advantage unp msdos  higher recommended since unp try allocate umbs lower version do work without much difference since unp us base memory umbs requires k memory additional amount memory required depending program processed general info       start using unp would like point thing might take consideration compressed exe file containing overlay may work correctly decompressed decompression expands code size exe file also mean overlay move program check overlay currently use constant get overlay case anything happen use unp convert file another structure please take consideration converted program never run exact condition though difference likely cause problem program always program expect changed conversion one way protect problem caused problem use unp b bak backup file creation option create copy original compressed file running uncompressed program find error simply delete bad copy rename bak file use unp        get help type unp command line without parameter use  switch first line help screen short line describing pas information unp let analyze step step usage unp command option path infile path outfile command e expand compressed file default command expands compressed file specify command unp use default using command without wildcard result unpacking file current directory c convert com file exe file converted com file using command convert file know exactly see general info section info want information file command use unp show information like e command decompress write file back l load save decompressing exe file command load exe file expand written back like decompressed file would written back useful case want remove overlay remove irrelevant header data search compressed file use command small list compressed file matching infile wildcard generated list created form  filenameext compressor  x convert exe file compressor compress exe file like lzexe command convert com file exe file resulting file written back exe extension default option help screen list unp command option use switch switch command used line ignored automatic retry file altered switch make unp process file changed useful want uncompress file also immunized cpav b make backup bak file original want keep backup original file wise use switch original file renamed file bak extension c ask confirmation decompressing force unp ask want decompress file time found new compressed file h remove irrelevant header data linkers add useless data exe header switch remove useless information thus shrinking header size intercept int h call default unp watch do interrupt h check program running expected unexpected call int h make unp abort process weird tsrs resident might use switch use debugging turbo debugger k pklite signature nt add add always ask switch handle pklite signature possibility k pklite signature added also case use k stay dislite compatible k always add pklite signature default unp well leave k switch away want k use unp ask time found signature like unp v earlier l allways use loadfix starting v unp fill first k base memory allows larger file processed unp detects file requires loadfix reload program first k allocated planning unpack several exepacked file might want use switch avoid reloading switch improve unp processing speed add anything new overwrite output file exists want destination file overwritten avoid question permission specifying switch command line p align header data page said exe file header size multiple byte load faster could make sense since sector also byte switch expand header nearest multiple byte r remove overlay data something appended exe called overlay switch let file size outfile load image anything appended file thrown away overlay used kind data removing result throwing away something useful u update file timedate current timedate default unp set timedate destination file timedate original source file want updated current timedate use switch v verbose use switch unp give additional information added switch debugging purpose path infile wildcard unp us selecting file process found follows specified command infile wildcard  used specified infile ofcourse used except wildcards without extension get appended flag set select com exe file infile end   appended path outfile destination file optional nt specify one source file overwritten use wildcards also specify destination

run memory file decompressed unp would nt run either however extracting pklite x resulted original file since version pklite hardly used even unlikely someone want decompress file nt bother write new routine fix bug pklite v according documentation add pk signature extra compressed file let program check still compressed pklite avoid program detects decompressed unp add default byte code place
