bring visual auditory hallucination prisoner feel losing objectivity state prisoner must keep endless argument interrogator may faced confession individual collaborated crime prisoner seriously begin doubt memory feeling heightened inability recall little thing like name people know well date birth interrogator patiently sharpens feeling doubt questioning tends create serious state uncertainty individual lost critical faculty prisoner must undergo additional internal conflict strong feeling guilt aroused within clinical psychologist aware difficult create feeling military serviceman particularly vulnerable one morally justify killing even wartime usual justification ground necessity selfdefence interrogator careful circumvent justification keep interrogation directed toward

communist control training provide trainee realistic appraisal control pressure interrogator likely exert usual human reaction pressure trainee must learn effective way combating reaction pressure
