string section real sense string nearperfect aural imitator modifier  ultimate parrot ability recognize good potential sample hear technique improves rapidly practice take time experiment gathering new sample teach nature structure sound well expand library sampling safari always try capture sound length need edit later using ability discard unwanted portion sample also good idea save memory disk making drastic irreversible change program sample forge ahead experiment nt want burn bridge behind one way get started take sample existing recording may original route provides excellent training art sampling cd player medium choice due sound quality ease cueing phonograph record even high quality cassette tape almost well library college large metropolitan area carry selection classical music cd phonograph record available rental modest fee note copyright implication sampling existing recording clear em endorse sampling recording copyrighted material consider moral ethical implication taking sound others recording regardless whether apply creative input sampling complex sound loud full orchestral texture prerecorded material quality playback medium important however delicate texture light string oboe etc almost require actual instrument played directly sampler sampled cd due inherent noise level tape vinyl time hook system stereo output mono line input adjust mixer balance control db greater difference left right channel prevents phase cancellation messing around high end andor hollowing bottom also watch recording level closely meter reach six dot far right lcd record display introduced digital distortion signal may notice anything amiss first however listen sample played octave original frequency  garbage  become evident found best single instrument sample fairly linear consistent attack decay envelope amplitude envelope flute piano nt change every note still sound natural ear even solo guitar sax exhibit high degree fluctuation sound especially attack tend sound much le natural played sampler  especially used  front  mix amazing much perfectly sampled recording sax sound like accordion try work range keyboard effect could good accordion sound work record guitar sax sound  straight  possible  pitch bend vibrato  add modulation pitchbending real time control wheel  ed great orchestral sample check point climax phrase section music ending also excellent place find chord  hit  besides classical selection soundtrack recording often ripe musical texture sample well loop easily keep mind student traditional instrument nearby college university often available sampling session sometimes need put notice music department bulletin board rule look suggestion drum related percussion sample everywhere beyond obvious capability sampling traditional drum sound practically anything used percussively handled creatively example sampling sound screwdriver tapping table gated reverb produce incredible explosive punch played octave sampled pitch effect sound huge cough chair squeak firecracker door slam grunt animal noise even laughter effectively  dress  otherwise routine drum kit incidentally gated reverb effect simplicity sample drum sound reverb truncate end suit  ed  second memory available maximum bandwidth khz even used simple manipulation vocal instrumental part within song sing play difficult phrase memory  presto  perform entire phrase press single key whenever need song totally acceptable guitar sample also made bandwidth narrowed around khz thus providing second sampling time concerning disk drive related command first foremost careful version   double checking  see really want erase file memory disk could spell trouble push button first ask question later advantage course veteran sampler save time answer  sure  type question always think act since many page put one keystroke away form annihilation avoid serious mishap getting practice consistently making backup disk treasured sample writeprotecting  keeper  disk remember disk never fails important session performance life  keep backup handy another disk operation quirk concern  return home  error response example error occurs trying save writeprotected disk machine  lock  blink led tell problem solution cute little message  oops disk write protected take close switch corner  lcd doesnt mention upon recovering error pressing disk button unfreeze machine load disk option page exact opposite wanted pressing enter key point would cause unit erase memory attempt load disk thus throwing hard work memory data oblivion always check selected right function attempting resave also note version  verify data writing disk chance save defective disk way knowing try unsuccessfully load back memory later time hopefully verify feature available later upgrade hint hint meanwhile solution make backup time dump memory disk odds two bad disk row pretty great unless spilled coke something equally devastating speaking devastating recommend nt even think using single sideddouble density ssdd disk mess regularly  least expect  used doublesided disk drive like saving money buying ssdd disk buying aggravation frustration use double sideddouble density disk dsdd allows ten character program sample filename take advantage give sample descriptive name make much easier locate swap sound around disk disk naming original sample pitch within filename eg flute tah dah c etc also big help especially constructing multiple sample instrument make much easier assign split point later working within program edit section also give sample identity independent program play learning competition akai faced traditional  cart horse  quandry made big decision release developing extensive library sampled sound however factory collection already breathtaking selection still growing get touch dealer every new factory disk expected released periodically feel software support important fact attribute much staying power emu famous emulator line sampler vast amount usergenerated sample generated factory also active user group emu support user go far sponsoring sound swap party opinion akai digital sampler thrive today hypercompetitive  today gone tommorrow  electronic music marketplace need support user group actively backed none akai meanwhile quite machine  especially learn operating system well enough bidding
