access internet far beyond scope document far many networking operating system pc tcpip implementation give much help department nt intimidated though proabably need talk network administrator begin configuring pcfsp heshe able get running remember pcfsp simple configure making system capable running pcfsp internet access software tricky iii configuring pcfsp            pcfsp depends file called
