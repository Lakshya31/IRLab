phile audio surveillance    sanctuary    audio common surveilance method use listening device depend form electronics important understand usual step audio electronic surveillance basically step process input usually microphone preamplifier used boost nominal signal mic usable level processing eliminates excess noise unwanted sound output output headphone recorder transmitter etc postprocessing sometimes phile deal microphone file deal step microphone judged frequency response sensitivity signaltonoise ratio sn durability size frequency response range sound give usable output mic human hearing roughly hz  hz surveillance work need hear frequency deal human speech sensitivity amount electrical output get given sound level surveillance mics need sensitive pick whisper speech distant room look sensitive mic performs well area signaltonoise ratio number decibel db louder mic noise input signal mics introduce hissing cracking electrical noise output good compact disc player sn ratio db totally inaudible human record give sn ratio  db give noise quiet passage good record good player little audible noise except quiet part db usually considered good surveillance gear condenser mics give lessthanextraordinary  db sn ratio electrical equipment add noise signal stage introduces noise noise introduced mic might almost unnoticable added inevitable noise component become quite annoying impedance opposition alternate current important transformer needed couple mic amp different impedences mics classified either high impedance low impedance high impedance mics tend lose high frequency response long run cable low impedance mics usually ohm high impedance mics  ohm range mics come built transformer switchable make high low impedance add bulk noise mic better transformer built preamplifier imperative surveillance match mic impedance interfacing machinery loss signal lower sn ratio may occur durability mic ability stand change humidity temperature well ability withstand shock dynamic electret mics generally durable size important surveillance work rule thumb small mic always preferable go unnoticed easily large one sometimes large mic incorporated well environment large dynamic mic installed stereo speaker system blend perfectly speaker inside several type mics suitable surveillance work common crystal condenser dynamic electret crystal mics microphone use crystal rochelle salt piezoelectric element piezoelectricity property acquiring oppositeelectrical charge opposing face assymetrical crystal subjected pressure closely related ceramic mic us barium titanate instead rochelle salt ceramic mic weather resistant slightly lower impedance condenser mics replaced crystal mics application high output high impedance low cost still find use application find use surveillance mainly contact mics spike mics probe linked directly crystal condenser mics one favorite clandestine work small offfer wide smooth frequency response fairly inexpensive condenser mics membrane change distance cause change capacitance cause electrical output one charged membrane flimsy sound alters distance built built ampifier change variable capacitance variable voltage current also drop impedance million ohm  ohm requires power supply usually either internal battery commonly mic draw power output lead often called phantom power frequency response good surveillance work good reach range human voice high end extends normal voice level soprano reach high end though dynamic mics basically speaker designed work reverseinstead changing electrical signal sound change sound electrical signal durable low impedance large compared electret mics fraction size dime often pick hz ac hum unless shielded perform poorly surveillance work electret mics without doubt best allaround surveillance mics work similarly condenser mics require le power permanent charge across membrane condenser mics use input voltage create charge across membrane mics nt cut surveillance work except unusual circumstance large ribbon mics used recording studio expensive fragile surveillance work along giving much wide frequency response carbon mics used used telephone mouthpiece fairly unusual large give mediocre resaponse ever watched mission impossible old spy film may seen hero unscrew mouthpiece phone take mic drop special transmitter called drop transmitter could inserted  standard  phone transmit conversation short distance pressure zone mics perhaps best uncommon mics really mic design electret condenser dynamic etc element pressure zone mics boundry
