chemist corner article explosive zaphod beebleboxmpg rewritten gray mouser call thief guild  article deal instruction creating dangerous explosive intend make explosive small amount dangerous could seriously injure kill done larger amount nt know anything chemistry nt experiment joking giving warning unless death wish nt try following unless prior experience chemical responsible injury damage caused people using info provided use people knowledgable chemistry interested experiment safely handle experiment common  weak  explosive gunpowder potassium nitrate charcoal sulfur chemical ground fine powder seperately morter pestle gunpowder ignited open burn fiercely closed space build pressure released gas explode container gunpowder work like potassium nitrate oxidizes charcoal sulfur burn fiercely carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide gas released b ammonal ammonal mixture ammonium nitrate strong oxidizer aluminum powder fuel case sure composition ammonal may want experiment little using small amount c chemically ignited explosive mixture part potassium chlorate part table sugar sucrose burn fiercely brightly similar burning magnesium drop concentrated sulfuric acid placed occurs acid added reacts potassium chlorate form chlorine dioxide explodes formation burning sugar well using various chemical developed mixture work well imitating volcanic eruption given name mpg volcanite tm potassium chlorate potassium perchlorate ammonium nitrate ammonium dichrmoate potassium nitrate sugar sulfur iron filing charcoal zinc dust coloring agent scarlet strontium nitrate purple iodine crystal yellow sodium chloride crimson calcium chloride etc  think water put fire one start mixture ammonium nitrate ammonium chloride iodine zinc dust drop two water added ammonium nitrate form nitric acid reacts zinc produce hydrogen heat heat vaporizes iodine giving purple smoke ammonium chloride becomes purple mixed iodine vapor also may ignite hydrogen begin burning ammonium nitrate gram ammonium choride gram zinc dust gram iodine crystal gram potassium permanganate glycerine mixed produce purplecolored flame sec min work best potassium permanagnate finely ground calcium carbide water release acetylene gas highly flammable gas used blow torch  ii thermite reaction thermite reaction used welding generates molten iron temperature c f us one previous reaction talked start starterpotassium chlorate sugar main pt iron iii oxide aluminum powder mesh finer put potassium chlorate sugar around top main pt start reaction place one drop concentrated sulfuric acid top starter mixture step back ratio part iron iii oxide part aluminum powder part potassium chlorate part sugar first try gggg also alternative starter thermite reaction alternative potassium permanangateglycerine amount g iron iii oxide g aluminum powder g potassium permanganate ml glycerine iii nitrogencontaining high explosive mercury ii fulminate produce mercury ii fulminate sensitive shock explosive one might assume could formed adding fulminic acid mercury somewhat difficult since fulminic acid unstable purchased research figured way make without fulminic acid add part nitric acid part alcohol part mercury theoretical yet tried please try small amount tell result b nitrogen triiodide nitrogen triiodide powerful shock sensitive explosive never store careful around itsound air movement tiny thing could set material g iodine ml concentrated ammonia sheet filter paper ml beaker feather mounted two meter pole ear plug tape spatula stirring rod add g iodine ml ammonia ml beaker stir let stand minute following within minute reatin solid decant liquid pour liquid keep brown solid  scape brown reisdue nitrogen triiodide onto stack four sheet filter paper divide solid four part putting seperate sheet dry filter paper tape position leave dry undisturbed least minute preferably longer detonate touch feather wear ear plug detonating cover ear loud c cellulose nitrate guncotton commonly knwon smokeless powder nitrocellulose exactly give smoke burn material ml concentrated sulfuric acid ml concentrated nitric acid g absorbent cotton ml sodium bicarbonate ml beaker ice bath tongs paper towel place ml beaker ice bath add ml sulfuric acid ml nitric acid divide cotton g piece tongs immerse piece acid solution minute next rinse piece successive bath ml water use fresh water piece immerse ml sodium bicarbonate bubble rinse water bubbling occurs squeeze dry spread paper towel dry overnight nitroglycerine nitroglycerine dangerous shock sensitive explosive used making dynamite among thing sure proportion amount chemical used shall use estimate material ml conc sulfuric acid ml conc nitric acid ml glycerine ice bath ml beaker put ml beaker ice bath make sure cold slowly add ml sulfuric ml nitric acid beaker trying maintain low temperature temperature start level add ml glycerine turn brown look funny run like hell nitroglycerine turn brown mean ready explode  stay clear work well keep temperature low let sit hour nitroglycerine probably mixed nitric sulfuric acid set must nearby nitroglycerine fill  time original area expanding gas mean ml nitroglycerine produce ml gas make dynamite nitroglycerine must absorbed something like wood pulp diamaeceous earth spelled something like iv stuff peroxyacetone peroxyacetone extremely flammable reported shock sensitive material ml acetone ml hydrogen peroxide drop concentrated hydrochloric acid mm test tube add ml acetone ml hydrogen peroxide test tube add drop concentrated hydrochloric acid  minute white solid begin appear change observed warm test tube water bath celsius allow reaction continue two hour swirl slurry filter leave filter paper dry least two hour ignite light candle tied meter stick light staying least meter away b smoke smoke smoke  following reaction produce fair amount smoke since reaction dangerous use larger amount necessary larger amount smoke g zinc powder g sulfur powder insert red hot wire pile step back lot smoke created  enjoyed textfile call   work  textfile bb     n baud pm mid  megabyte online antirbbs network sysops jason scott terror ferret
