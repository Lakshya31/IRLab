fairly easy learn bullet jacket different wall thickness different caliber make also within jacket commercial jacket taper control expansion mean seat lead core jacket core small enough fit easily whatever jacket using buy set dy made punch certain jacket change another jacket going commercial drawn jacket copper tubing jacket probably need obtain different core seating punch core seating punch fit inside jacket rather die whenever want bullet lead seated past jacket mouth bullet large lead tip semiwadcutters lead round nose bullet made using core seating punch fit seal pressure die wall instead inside jacket change  inch wall jacket one wall  inch thickness need punch considerably smaller diameter fit new jacket order dy either let corbin supply right jacket fit send sample jacket
