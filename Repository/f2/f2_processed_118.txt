loses consciousness body temperature fall may die objective treatment shock objective first aid care shock improve circulation blood ensure adequate supply oxygen maintain normal body temperature proper first aid treatment shock give urgent first aid eliminate cause shock stoppage breathing hemorrhaging severe pain step preventing shock giving first aid shock follows keep victim lying b keep covered enough prevent loss body heat c summonobtain professional medical help victim position must based injury generally satisfactory position injured person lying improve blood circulation injury neck lower spine suspected move victim properly prepared transportation unless necessary protect injury provide urgent first aid care victim severe wound lower part face jaw unconscious placed side allow drainage fluid avoid blockage airway vomitus blood extreme care must taken provide open airway prevent asphyxia place victim difficulty breathing back head shoulder raised person back injury may kept flat propped head must lower rest body victim severe brain injury may unconscious unconsciousness cause shock unless also associated fracture major wound doubt concerning correct position basis injury keep victim lying flat victim shock may improve foot foot stretcher raised inch position help improve blood flow lower extremity doubt whether victim foot raised keep victim flat increased difficulty breathing experience additional pain foot raised lower keep victim warm enough overcome avoid chilling exposed cold dampness place blanket additional clothing prevent chilling add extra heat raising surface temperature body harmful shock victim heat draw diverted blood supply back skin vital organ thus robbing critically needed blood caution prohibition giving fluid victim although giving fluid mouth value shock fluid given medical help trained ambulance personnel reach scene hour exception victim unconscious convulsion vomiting likely vomit may aspirate fluid lung given fluid
