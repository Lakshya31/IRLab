midi interface ibm pc david rudy trubitt september issue electronic musician looking midi interface ibm pc compatible system nt consider simple hardware purchase interface use big impact software able run unlike macintosh atari st serial communication driver built pc operating system reason interface software automatically compatible de facto standard roland midi processing unit mpu introduced n principal selling point mpu intelligent mode take care many important midi talk without bogging pc central processor ibm pc le poser today model mpu processing capability useful roland offered mpu chip company making easy make compatible product enough mpustyled interface sold nearly every software company support stay competitive still case even program designed specifically nonmpu interface usually offer mpucompatible version mpu biggest advantage today software compatibility want run largest number program especially shareware looking mpucompatible interface today typical pccompatible increased power point nt need help intelligent mode offer also roland mpu chip discard midi time code mtc message intelligent mode alternative mpu operate guessed dumb mode also called uart mode pas mtc message case computer responsible everything feature intelligent mode lost many developer support mpu today using dumb mode despite extra work entail mean user pay unused feature several manufacturer taken basic mpu added additional midi port smpte readwrite capability nonmusical type smpte time code used mainly multitrack recording audiovideo syncing  lc interface function like plain mpu unless software specifically written updated support additional feature check software manufacturer find software support  extra  interface provides nonmpu interface mpu compatible interface must

parallel interface mpucompatible achieve midi rate  kilobaud guy thought modem hot stuff  lc serial midi interface run pc serial port higher rate originally intended case problem although one software vendor cited potential throughput problem dense datastreams number serial interface available gaining support among software vendor parallel port potential advantage serial port host midi interface suprisingly one parallel port midi interface market today eclipse hr builtin sound prepackaged system several manufacturer make card incorporate interface onboard synthesizer wellsuited educational

however nearly every case signal put tape incompatible exception four different frame rate smpte driving thing anyway transmit receive midi message special software program called device driver used application program communicates driver program rather interface typically device driver designed application program driver incompatible program program acheive blissful state independence user selects software hardware without concern compatibility systemwide driver must written support number interface programmer must agree support protocol used driver driver also designed manage access several program simultaneously multitasking environment microsoft window  playroom software close releasing midi executive program driver several popular interface also manage one interface

offer sort midi support fuuture version although microsoft offering may le sophisticated playroom possibility two compete developer support solution like playroom could real step forward midi ibm pc summary let software need drive hardware purchase nt sure future need mpu compatible interface safe choice putting together system primarily run one package ask software vendor recommendation
