assembler speed make full use capability wo nt run xtpcat  system shareware notice fast encrypt shareware mean want continue use product expected support author time spent developingwritingdebugging program register program simply print file orderfrm send write information hand nt printer fast encrypt  crippleware  feature disabled program  selfdestruct  certain period time ask register day use enough time test see capability registration site license also available write information use key   first run fast encrypt asked character key must enter character choice may use symbol ascii character remember case sensitive forget key able unencrypt file without key  backdoor   magickeys  forget key wo nt able help example valid key barbersare neat ppovm da anything work remember must type exactly thing want decrypt mean barbersare neat barbersare neat tip key selection     use key totally unrelated anything nt use phone number social securtity number etc include upper lower case letter also least one symbol key  like using weird character increase difficulty brute force cracking key since character combination tried instead alphabet substitution box    type key fill substitution box may take several second slower substitution one main way fast encrypt encrypts data see technical explanation fill substitution box ask want save substitution box disk saving substitution box disk allow encryptdecrypt much want key without build substitution box every time run program save lot time however anyone access substitution box saved disk decrypt data never save substitution box computer diskette somebody get access fast encrypt automatically find saved substitution box ask want use answer prompted enter new key substitution box stored disk file called externalkey encryptdecrypt  subsitution box createdloaded disk ask want encrypt decrypt encrypt scramble file decrypt unscrambles file   must enter two file name first one file processed encrypted decrypted second file output placed example encrypt decrypt ed e enter name file whateverxxx enter name output file must different input file whatevercpt example whateverxxx encrypted encrypted version placed whatevercpt valid do namesextentions valid use path also ok c doswhateverxxx allowed either input output encryptiondecryption  entered data encrypted decrypted go quickly except really big file course may find encrypted file slightly larger original never byte larger nt matter much file decrypted file return original size reason discussed technical section end documentation command line support  desired fast encrypt run completely command line structure command line simple first thing entered command line encryptdecrypt selector also indicates whether process file key command line load externalkey capital letter e entered key loaded command line lower case letter e entered externalkey used next information entered input file file processed output file output put command line key selected key final thing entered command line character entered first used le character entered unused space assigned zero value example fe e whateverin whateverout hereismykeyok encrypts

contact author even nt registered yet known bug fast encrypt greatfull would let know find one emailus mail perfered method contact however phone service provided registered user sure include necessary detail mail sent fast encrypt tested do o  o  fact developed mostly osdos o hpfs drive several system running various do o configuration problem encountered internet mharris clovisfeltoncaus u mail michael harris blueberry dr scott valley ca technical info encryption method    method fast encrypt us encrypt data basically much improved version de nothing known wrong de algorithm many including author feel key size de us small adequetly protect data key size fast encrypt us bit character bit make bit total number possible key massive number digit nt taken time calculate exactly two method fast encrypt us encrypt substitution permutation substitution name implies take group byte place different group byte place think like one puzzle letter switched different letter figure say essentially fast encrypt much larger scale substituting byte block  th power possible value puzzle example letter alphabet fast encrypt go substitution process time time different substitution box substitution box functionally dependant key substitution permutation permutation switch order bit occur combination make virtually impossible break encryption even multiple array fastest supercomputer working literally hundred thousand year course practical encryption program secure fastencrypt nt secure doesnt claim method truthfully claim totally safe either nt encryption method mathmatically proven uncrackable  onetimetape  method however method requires key longer encrypted key must contain totally random number key must never repeated example wanted encrypt megabyte file would key greater megabyte size make totally useless daily use file grow slightly encrypted       stated fast encrypt work block byte mean impossible encrypt group byte smaller byte however file world divide evenly byte block mean fast encrypt must  fill  needed byte encrypting last block also must save byte indicates many byte last block  original  one decrypts file return correct size program    fast encrypt written entirely assembler done good encryption program painfully slow make full use bit processing ability lot area programming easier program ran much faster larger register built borland tm
