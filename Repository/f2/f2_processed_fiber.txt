decrease bile acid returned liver would cause diversion cholesterol lipoprotein synthesis synthesis bile acid thereby lowering serum cholesterol another proposed mechanism involves fibre stimulated shift bile acid pool toward chenodexoycholic acid  inhibits cholesterol synthesis thought chenodeoxycholate alert liver inhibition key enzyme cholesterol needed bile acid synthesis still neither proposed mechanism fully explains degree fibre lower serum cholesterol another effect fibre influence cation adsorption particularly calcium zinc iron cationic bridge formed fibre serve mechanism
