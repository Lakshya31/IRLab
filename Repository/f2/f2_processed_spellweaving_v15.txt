 spell weaving v alternative ad spell system robert winkel willie werpleapanaorgau made system modified several time various idea seen around internet combine much thought best point presented prior work jim gitzlaff jim sisolak matthew stanton people take much credit article anything article nt prior work surely inspired system designed flexibility mind intended unbalancing fact run campaign normal ad spell casting system two style magic possible one campaign also possible use system basis almost magic style eg balgarion spell casting  magician  fantasy novel may read flexibility system tends promote individuality amoungst spell caster make high level magic something take seriously time make low level magic appealing overall system give spell user flexibility balancing power curve another plus system make full usage official unofficial ad spell know love limit system playtested campaign lasted year time modified make thing fun balancing without adding complexity mechanic general rule away spell component spell component view alternative energy source need used unless absolutely necessary spell eg portal wizard lock spell component still help spell casting flexible system need exact spell component spell description player handbook ad book dm decides whether spell component appropriate modifier add see eg fireball spell sulphur might give  glowworm  red dragon scale  spellpoints used system make spell user versatile fun play combat game balance  utility belt  problem make spell user lot powerful balanced give spell user variety spell choose lesser amount spell cast per day compared standard ad spell system spell user receive number spellpoints equal one per level number cumulative plus one thus specific level spell user posse following number spellpoints level spellpoints level spellpoints        etc etc mathematician high level spell user lover formula spellpoints level level spell cost double level spellpoints cast thus first level spell cost two third level spell six ninth level spell eighteen leave single spellpoint behind caster odd number spell point spell user opt put spellpoints spell make succeed result see spell caster convert spellpoints spell freely two exception first spell must known memorized spell caster knowing standard ad meaning spell first encountered wizard must try make chance learn new spell roll fails roll never learn cast spell dm might rule however different version spell exist world mage find one version may try learn wizard memorize one time number spell per spell level equal number  maximum spellslvl  column intelligence chart player handbook wizard automatically memorize number spell equal wizard maximum spell level must make chance memorize spell roll every spell maximum capacity fails roll certain spell mean wizard forever unable memorize spell question merely understand magical pattern day may try sleep period note mean wizard intelligence able memorize spell come across except spell may never learn see second spell user convert spellpoints spell way cast spell given level would able memorize orininal ad system example wizard allowed original ad system memorize third level spell posse exactly thirdlevel  slot  may converted spell spellpoints permitting may course cast le number desire restriction imposed order maintain higher level realism wizard allowed freely allocate spellpoints spell level would possible wizard convert overproportion high level spell example without restriction would possible realistic allow th level mage assign spellpoints sixth level spell mental fatigue would unrealistic thus limit number high level spell spell user cast situation likened athlete many long marathon certain period still short run sprint since also unrealistic th level mage instance able cast rd level spell already cast thereby using rd level slot still able cast th th th level spell mage opt use higher spell slot cast lower level spell eg case th level mage use th level slot cast rd level spell note still cost basic spell point wizard need relearn spell every night continue cast spell day day without problem long spellpoints slot factor might motivate wizard spend time relearn spell  memory loss  caused illness injury magic new spell  memorize totally new spell change spell  exchange memorized spell unmemorized known spell intelligence ceiling reached remember rememorizing chance learn must rolled order comprehend give spellweaving wizard added advantage carry valuable spellbooks adventure unless feel probable need relearn spell want study get spell back soon possible without sleeping see spellpoints recovered sleep study meditation weary mind tends forget thing sleep refresh memory power concentration could truer spellweaver instead spellweaver nt time sleep cram session may order remind weary mind focusing study also option spellweavers study attempted distracted fatigued fatigued mean gone without sleep extended period use whatever fatigue rule wizard study must spellbook handy spt percentage recovered sleep study meditation maximum hr  hr hr  hr hr  hr hr  hr  hr  hr thus wizard sleep hour reap benefit wizard would get back total spellpoints slept  hour studied hour case percentage refer number spellpoints wizard total number spellpoints spell caster full power meditation period given campaign dm us meditation nonweapon proficiency spell rule written happens spell miscast nothing  never occurs either caster know spell perfectly else chance casting even worse spell user know spell want slight variation eg light spell produce green light glowing bird dancing light spell must spend time money researching whole new spell system designed take account factor system wizard concentrate magical energy pattern confident exact picture pattern mind therefore wizard spend extra time concentrating even take big risk cut short casting time spell thereby getting spell quickly risking letting loose nonexact magical pattern energy maybe even spell backfire note caster distracted casting still continue try cast spell penalty distraction see cancel spell cancelling spell done time still take lot wizard therefore still us spell point wizard injured casting spell spell wasted spell point used specifically casting success roll structured follows caster level  spell level special modifier caster level modifier level experience spell caster divided three rounded thus th level mage would add  th level mage would  spell level higher level spell call upon magical energy much greater power upon magical pattern much greater complexity lower level one reasonable therefore spell difficult cast penalty  level spell thus th level spell would  penalty special modifier include various adjustment spell casting applied certain circumstance specific campaign situation listed wisdom magical defense adjustment represents comprehension magical pattern weaving injury caster lost original hit point  caster lost original hit point  caster lost original hit point  cumulative damage taken round prior start casting hp dam damage taken casting spell cancelled specialization wizard casting spell specialized school  wizard casting spell  opposition  school  fatigue hindrance etc fatigued caster gone without sleep day without sleep distracted   caster cast spell consecutively round eg round spell get  penalty spell cast round regardless casting time incur  penalty penalty avoided waiting least round casting another spell simulates difficulty spell weaver face attempting completely wipe mind one magical pattern straight away concentrating new pattern reason penalty apply spell recast different spell caster wearing illegal armour shield  armour ac eg leather give  penalty full plate give  penalty full plate  give  penalty note spell caster shield casting spell allowed somatic component thus  penalty applied see leaving spell component improvisation attempting minor variation known spell  eg  green fireball  based fireball attempting major variation known spell  eg  snowball  based fireball great variation dm might rule equal higher level spell thus needing spell point eg fireball spell double radius damage per die dm must make sure improvised spell us magical energy base spell casting unmemorized spell known  spends extra time concentrating time unit max unit phase spell casting time phase round spell casting time round etc spends le time concentrating phase round instantaneous casting possible instantaneous casting minimum  penalty applies even spell normally cast one segment spell trickery  spellcraft roll tricky technique used order make potential spell user spellcraft proficiency think completely different spell cast actual spell spellweaver must spell component spell faked use spell component real spell faked spell different casting time real spell spellweaver must adjust spending le time concentrating take appropriate bonus penalty energy source per extra spellpoint used spell  max spell level ie wizard straining immensely concentrate spell pattern per two hit point sacrificed casting  max ie wizard us physical energy well mental hit point healed normally nose bleeds immense sweating etc common using method per str con point sacrificed casting  recovered slowly  day week year may required similar sacrificing hit point greater extent spell component used   dm decides appropriate eg typical material component used lightning bolt spell might crystal glass iron rod  holy symbol god weather  live eel  spell component used alternate source magical energy used focus magical energy taken cosmic pool spellweavers mental energy leaving spell component verbal somatic component based theory verbal somatic component way making easier spell user comprehend magical pattern sort like child count aloud finger dm determine whether reasonable discard spell component eg ca nt discard verbal component spell like command power word kill etc ca nt discard somatic component spell like finger death shocking grasp etc modifier totalled plus others dm wish add covered player roll sided die add modifier determine whether successful table show possible outcome  modified roll result see                               wow  spell work bit better normal  spell work normal  spell partially work  spell fizzle effect spell backfire  exception natural  spell partially work  modifier rolling greater  spell work normal  natural  spell work bit better normal  modifier rolling  le  spell work normal  use better result natural rolled worst natural rolled eg  modifier rolled natural could pick either  spell work bit better normal  rolled natural  wow  rolled total  wow  better two result take wow spell caster get higher roll something great happens suggestion spell doubled effect every statistic double damage done info gained permanent rare etc spell work bit better normal cast spell function perfectly little bit expected suggestion extra energy source used  damage per die creature affected etc spell work normal spell work intended spell partially work spell nt live expectation suggestion every statistic spell including damage done applicable halved spell affect others detrimental caster faint etc spell backfire mean part spell energy backfire upon caster many different thing might happen always equal force level spell thus backfired detect magic much watch time stop wish typical effect damage done caster false information lose spellpoints equal level spell etc important remember table suggestion dm player must get together interpret result creatively magic horribly dangerous thing  caster target  result stimulate appreciation risk ruin game also advisable try make accident appropriate spell failed instance fire based spell would likely make caster pseudowerewolf might well accidently summon fire elemental engulf caster flame responsibility make decision left dm easily tabulated basically system balance wizard level sudden jump power high level also encourages little bit lower level spell usage making higher level spell thing handled care also introduces unpredictability type spell outcome making magic even thing mystery fear lower level wizard tend risk leaving spell component really worry much penalty high level wizard casting high level spell tend put much spell possible little chance possible spell backfire disastrous result robert winkel willie werpleapanaorgau
