info pulled usenet air atmosphere railway system today yesterday             ultimate responsibility thread belongs george medhurst  england period year invented three distinct form airpropelled transport none implemented lifetime saw use eventually reaching greatest extent reverse order original invention medhurst first method involved moving air tube inch diameter pushing capsule along simple idea pneumatic dispatch tube next realized system built much larger could carry passenger freight item larger letter natural run vehicle track became known since vehicle would large enough require track became known pneumatic railway would anyone actually want ride along mile mile inside opaque pipe likely thought piston moving within pipe somehow dragging along vehicle outside proposed several version idea vehicle ran rail became known atmospheric railway though distinction term pneumatic railway always observed key feature version system longitudinal valve sort flexible flap running length pipe would held closed air pressure except piston actually passing medhurst try raise capital implement system failed first operable steam locomotive built steampowered train see regular use passenger year steam railway shown practical engineering financial sens technical development made possible practical steam railway also made atmospheric railway certainly practical least worth try offered prospect considerable advantage since train would nt carry prime mover would lighter therefore track could built cheaper train performance would better train would nt trail smoke wherever went passenger car particular would also quiet one section route hilly required motive power needed would larger pumping station along section need add extra locomotive short much advantage electricity gave decade later plus one derailed train would tend kept near track pipe piston success railway gave rise railway mania interest railway share reached absurd level climate proposer atmospheric line could find backing needed four atmospheric line opened period year order opening dublin kingstown kingstown dalkey ireland  mile long operated  london croydon croydon forest hill

newton newton abbot mile altogether operated  note passing fan might like isambard kingdom brunel invented atmospheric system used south devon wrong say choose actively promoted well  actively  redundant brunel actually developed samuel clegg joseph jacob samuda longer shorterlived english line used atmospheric propulsion direction travel whereas french irish line built hill train simply returned downhill gravity since singletrack line oneway system simplified valve needed let piston pipe end possibly traveling speed four line converted ordinary steam railway end next year atmospheric system appeared dead one thing steam locomotive technology much head start development atmospheric system steam railway might delay due engine failure never shut week new design longitudinal valve installed along entire length route valve involved metal leather part greasy waxy sealant  composition  although story told rat eating composition probably happen sometimes nt really serious thing biggest problem fact freezing deterioration leather corrosion metal part also atmospheric system inflexible power requirement section route greater estimated little could done short splitting section adding whole new pumping station line used vacuum rather positive pressure pipe limited pressure differential  atmosphere practice valve design marginal anyway likely would nt stood greater pressure could used today might seen serious disadvantage requirement long interruption motive power junction noticeable day train nt enough speed coast across gap well thirdclass passenger could always get push maybe would horse conveniently hand station small auxiliary pipe used advance train platform start main pipe many proposal day atmospheric line view early failure none ever built atmospheric railway next atmospheric railway open actually appeared atmospheric railway vanishing first pneumatic dispatch tube beginning appear get later start pneumatic railway idea began return also first designed freight engineer j latimer clark w rammell formed pneumatic despatch company built demonstration tube ground battersea line successfully carried load ton  even passenger lying vehicle inch tunnel pressure used  atmosphere speed mph reached post office became interested system several tunnel built used though interrupted time financial crisis point decided system nt gain enough time worth cost mention risk vehicle becoming stuck tube electricity available returned driverless train system using tunnel similar size old pneumatic tube post office  tube  railway continues use day
