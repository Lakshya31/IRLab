entire nation sits riveted television set news outcome life death success failure one sensitive squeeze away one pressured situation law enforcement occurs police sniper called upon neutralize suspect police encounter critical responsibility reduced perfect execution one shot room error example recent hostage incident police marksman fire hit suspect three time shot accurate precise deadly instantaneously badly wounded suspect survived long enough kill female hostage dying point criticize one officer performance incredible pressure rather better understand pressure address police rifle marksmanship training article summarizes critical training technique contribute perfect performance actual police sniper engagement special shooting exercise improve likelihood perfect oneshot performance even physical psychological stress background minnesota national guard countersniper school day course sniper team including law enforcement beginning course instructor issue one live round student caution final course fire must hit specially designated target single round fail course throughout training student continually reminded success depends hitting one target round day training shot record fire instructor provide student fresh round one carried past week student called upon engage one special halfsize silhouette stress accompanying shot purely psychological largely selfinduced one shout student physical stress accompanies special oneshot kill yet based experience percent student sniper fail relatively simple shot student police officer failure record student achieved high score preliminary shot record fire fact time marksman shot perfect record fire miss oneshot kill event probability special stress factor affected sniper performance emphasis placed one shot stress factor emerge training similar sniper must overcome achieve perfect oneshot performance real incident factor affecting performance  know thyselfknow thy rifle  achieve nearperfect

individually critical police sniper maintain record book note history fire particular rifle help sniper concentrate shot also help identify minor deviation  book  data versus rifle ammunition generates information data card example sniper may learn first shot fired practice  socalled  cold barrel zero   could vary several inch subsequent shot exacting attention detail sniper develop precision marksman focus threeshot group individual shot sniper pace practice fire mentally planning shot analyzing afterward also useful dry fire livefire shot five round fired single target better focus shooter concentration also accomplished marksman fire  round total practice session prevent sliding undisciplined  banging away  habitually applying proven technique practice fire sniper develop patience concentration discipline critical precision shooting pressure perform pressure perform purely psychological selfinduced result allowing concentration waver person realizes others expect exceptional performance reflects drop selfconfidence subtle doubt success attainable perform successfully police sniper must allow feel rushed merely someone give  green light  doubt must channeled mentally oblivion contrary belief public competition alleviate doubt pressure perform attention focused sniper alone expect perfect result totally different pressure experienced competition real incident sniper competing one learning overcome external distraction concentration matter hand shooting exercise sniper fire individually observed teammate well experiencing noise light distraction even conspicuous presence nonsniper observer increase pressure firing exercise perfection expected last factor  opening day syndrome  occurs individual suddenly find facing situation real expected

expected learn error except training proper training practice fire valuable realistic training allows sniper prepare physically mentally function stressfilled incident officer drill shootdo nt shoot scenario practical pistol course hone skill realistic setting must police sniper train beyond  bullseye  shooting perform effectively turn mechanical act shooting mechanical act shooting accurately pressure practical shooting exercise taking account various stress police sniper must operate exercise developed help acquire quality needed perform  concentration patience discipline confidence first practice session clearly divided two phase  practice fire exercise practice fire officer fire bullseye target individually pace using pronesupport position bipod sandbag record shot confirm zero thus preparing exercise follow second phase sniper engage specially modified silhouette target learning focus vital area make exercise demanding therefore affixed silhouette balloon either head center chest size balloon proportional distance  inch yard inch yard inch yard using balloon lessthanprecise shot otherwise would credited  excellent  becomes complete miss psychologically instant feedback watching  bad guy  wave back cause sniper resolve hone skill likewise confidence soar repeated success purpose exercise marksmanship practice sniper already completed application underscore emphasis oneshot kill sniper receive one round engagement miss balloon engage help recognize mentally finality shot fired also instill  pressure perform  sniper complete several exercise individually others watch external light sound distraction variety sniper fire exercise daylight night artificial illumination interestingly student fired well bullseye practice exaggerated expectation first fire exercise typically initially miss however several drill quickly acquire necessary skill successful engagement fleeting target frequent exercise used training almost duplicate reality rifleman issued green light know generally suspect appear must wait target surface second start exercise sniper allowed see target comfortably  lock  readying rifle could long wait target lowered rotated point next minute target reappears student start second exposure skill improve time exposure lessens second exercise help rifleman develop patience concentration range lack rotating target simulation achieved range officer stopwatch pacing back forth behind shooter officer suddenly shout  green light  slap particular shooter leg put shooter notice within next minute subject appear fired upon version conducted randomly multiple hostage exercise two similarly colored balloon tightly bracket third balloon represents suspect balloon hostage arranged horizontally balloon indicate need correct adjustment wind vertically emphasize adjustment trajectoryrange adding hostage pressure escalates concern possible miss concern accidentally hitting hostage even slight crosswind bounce balloon requiring carefully placed shot forcing highest level concentration noise light distraction presence observer enhance pressure applied exercise surgical shooting timed exercise elevates complexity level hostage rescue shooting range three  x inch portrait juxtaposed target start exercise shooter positioned yard firing line allowed second study mugshot suspect shooter must dash halfway firing line snatch one round low crawl final  yard weapon load spot correct suspect engage suspect dash back finish line expended cartridge timing start instant shooter see mugshot exercise  go  shooter fails hit suspect mistakenly hit hostage fails bring back expended cartridge exercise teach student focus suspect face instead attire preclude changing clothes well develop concentration discipline physical conditioning using photograph similarlooking people increase degree difficulty example target white male short hair using side view suspect altering suspect appearance sunglass changing hairstyle length hair make harder shooter select correct target firing yard becomes team event requires sniper spotter spotting scope ensure correct identification simultaneous engagement three balloon arranged exactly multiple hostage exercise time one hostage two suspect requires two sniper engage exactly time one officer called base sniper coordinate fire partner confirms ready engage respective suspect call  three two one  countdown fire hear  n  one base sniper drill teach control breathing order able fire talk partner learns time fire weapon accurate shot squeezed someone else order addition useful multiple target technique used smash plate glass one round take suspect accurately round arriving split second later noise light distraction increase exercise difficulty also voiceactivated radio enable two sniper positioned distance apart neutralizing shot exercise demand true precision challenge shooter place accurately round suspect neural motor strip brain stem tiny impact point head shot neutralize human almost instantly  option left  engagement suspect pressing weapon hostage anything neutralizing shot could still allow trigger pulled since intended impact point le inch wide exercise practiced attempted yard although yard preferable target lifesize human head photograph side view engaging neural motor strip ear back view engaging brain stem area highlighted help sniper focus correct impact point evaluate result clearly exercise made demanding imposing time limit adding visual noise distraction presence onlooker demanding level would combine fleeting target exercise fog battle exercise pit three sniper single target however one rifleman actually fire considerable peer pressure posted yard range single target board displaying three different  x inch facial photograph sniper rifle grounded firing line shooter clustered behind line around range officer range officer command one smoke grenade released range smoke build sniper study mugshot identical one target photo range officer give one live round sniper satisfied target thoroughly masked smoke range officer issue green light sniper rush weapon peering rifle scope sniper wait smoke dissipate enough identify correct photo first shooter shout  got  one allowed engage shooter second shooter  call  target prematurely others miss nt even get shot others prone choke front onlooker exercise help overcome handicap helping sniper gain confidence judgment shooting ability repeated merely several set mugshot photostargets posted range however must conducted yard le facilitate identification rifle scope followup shot exercise actually contradiction philosophy oneshot kill drill sniper must rebolt weapon instantly prepare reengage target even perfectly fired shot disrupted sudden gust wind slightly deflected invisible wire result wounding hit exercise two balloon placed single silhouette sniper issued number round loaded rifle add pressure timed event begin first shot fired end last shot fired regardless time lapsed shooter earns  go  balloon hit conclusion accuracy sole determinant police sniper performance quality concentration discipline confidence patience must honed fire successfully pressure procedure shooting exercise contribute shooter psychologically physically prepared neutralize suspect  one pressured situation law enforcement
