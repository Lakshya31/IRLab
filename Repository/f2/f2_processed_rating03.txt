              nt used intention let le year frp experience buy castle guide arm equipment guide favourite thing tsr really like dmgr series recycled dragon stuff highly unessential ok unnecessary campaign sourcebook catacomb guide dmgr                       sample dungeon bland unimaginative hint staging game worthwhile campaign book give lot general info designing campaign encouraging good roleplaying different campaign theme course design dungeon hole ground found info immensely useful enhancing adventure also help get creative juice flowing problem could call one much info hard remember good stuff  recommend novice gm far best series one tsrs leatherette handbook actually really really good book would great turning beginning dm journeyman seems book like one huge dragon magazine article opinion good thing could however done without  empty dungeon  abbreviated useful dm start without book best ever bought tsr castle guide dmgr             castle guide useful plus got expected looking course go much detail building castle also go lot useful information knighthood life medieval castle surrounding village even jousting archery competition give manual high mark negative comment one thing formula used computing cost building castle time take little confusing coming someone taken calculus year  plus think unrealistic assuming everything simple hut multiwalled concentric castle time base construction think added scaling factor reflect upon size project  according description material used build castle x section wooden wall take manyears build memory serf construction time x section wooden wall actually listed one man week information page cg would indeed seem suggest minimum time building anything half year would anyone used rule like comment goth ton fun castle guide  planning hideous thing happen people wanted build castle thing nd edition game ran played lowlevel spelljammer book useful want plot entire castle going see battle also note feudalism taxation might useful basically book could live without arm equipment guide dmgr                 get mentioned couple time thought nice goth clarify mistake several error st print phb reprinted page  aaeg correction weapon size composite long bow l flight arrow sheaf arrow light quarrel light crossbow javelin short sword club damage v l goth arm equipment guide although useful see weapon least one particular version look like doesnt contain new material place except oriental adventure seen picture mancatcher palladium various weapon book much useful contain much information even ad product line  aurora whole realm catalogue  useful supplement tsr yet put although weaponry much useful reference guide equipment anything else pc might conceivably want liked arm equipment guide described well million sword middle age really helped designing different clothes character also like partial ac system horse barding arm equipment guide make mistake first printing nd edition player handbook dmrg decent supplement get palladium product instead got ton detail weapon culture ummm  mace included  complete  weapon list arm equipment great included player handbook would like see info le fluff though particularly useful book armor section useless except describtion banded splint mail included ph good aspect weapon section reintroduction broad sword clothing decriptions could easily looked merriamwebster campaign live without one also would like comment book portion castle guide tend stifle novice dm implying one run campaign resembles anything prerenaissance england monstrous compendium denizen bounding around sherwood forest arm equipment guide would screwy silly thing mistake like say l xbow size quarrel size armour nt price weapon cfhb nt included least book arm equipment guide really worth owning imho nevertheless aurora whole realm catalog complete fighter handbook almost make arm equipment guide superfluous good artwork nice story liven exellent addition nonhistorian could incorporated phb though nonessential anyone need know much various piece equipment good reference sometimes detail come handy clothing section add flavor character npc liked arm equipment guide simply enjoyed historical infomation provided regarding various weapon helpful within actual game monster mythology dmgr             monster mythology good expansion legend lore corresponds badly priest handbook pointless contradicts several sourcebooks race popular enough demand sourcebook let god detailed also pc race god vary campaign world campaign world book god generic even mostly monster race love book bought cause dwarf handbook dwarf god pleasantly surprised see pantheon major nonhuman deity pc race great stuff campaign building fleshing boring orc colony dmgr worth money unless really want expand nonhuman god nt like idea generic priest need plenty god book provides perfect mixture god every important nonhuman race using found maybe thanks rather bad english serious mistake underlined summarized  book really ok good solid supplement many priesthood well thought tsr made gaming populace wait long demihuman specialist priest priest help give humanoid teeth higherlevel character pleased reintroduction demon prince arent sessinek panzuriel new however nt think every monster specie need godgods introducing deity without priesthood simply infuriates good volume information like legend lore one dm probably use orcus monster mythology comprehensive book lot information found useful creating npc nonhuman priest one problem deity seem  cross  forgotten realm oerth others another problem lack illustration colorful book otherwise say good buy run lot npc nonhuman priest want design nonhuman temple around specific deity finally summary rule nonpc priest sphere imagine running shaman kobold oooh like book included legend lore since library still bad lower plane greater power first edition mostly removed ie demon devil good source deity monster still keep first edition mm mm ff around creative campaigning dmgr               two part three book useless like section freestyle gaming really liked section freestyle gaming sample world sample adventure illustrating structure give much waste paper afraid book got wrong name  creative ha ha ha may campaigning little useless book perfect waste good plus tax seems confusing novice dm journeyman dm could think better idea two long chapter basically advertisement one author plug historical reference one  grand tour  hawk tsr campaign world tsr ashamed printing one creative campaigning interesting idea pretty lame complete book villain               villain book bad emphasis uniqueness characterization antagonist heavy firepower give example nonevil enemy complete book villain excellent job cover think little narrow side dmg reference imo cover wider scope thing book covering recurring problem like monster even natural phenomenon instead concentrating single individual cover cover well one pretty good nothing special left generic sample villain random table spent time telling customize villain complete book villain good however application seems limited would never go trouble suggests create villain got lot extra time hand   end
