 hacking control data corporation cyber  article cover getting using no networking operating system version  running cyber computer cybers generally run operating system refer environ ment cyber also cyber slow outdated operating system primarily used college campus running compiler first scanned bunch carrier need know cyber identifies go like welcome no software system copyright control data   n csus cyber  no  family would normally hit return family prompt next prompt user name usernames format abcdxxx location account used az b grouping specifying privs limit account usually ag lowest access example would used college system lowest access class account student b slightly higher student working large project c much higher limit account usually hard get normally last long time lab assistant use instructor lecturer professor etc e  hard get c position usually constant according grouping example class would account ranging nadraaaazz   also digit also special operator account start digit instead number ie etpdoc account run program monitor observe tty connected system  next prompt password student account password changed random letter default account password changed get try logged difficult impossible use brute force hacker try guess someone account get one easy way  go local college make sure cyber computer buy class catalog cost around cent could look borrow steal someone else  find pascal fortran class fit schedule attend class time max get trouble instructor asks question roll tell auditing class taking without enrolling wo nt affect gpa instructor usually pas account rd th day class method also work well system campus another way get account go computer lab start snooping look someone shoulder type password look thru someone paper bathroom look thru assistant desk helping someone  acquired account way first way alot easier le hassle also use comma instead return entering username password example family prompt could type nadrajf dsfgkcd username prompt nadrajf dsfgkcd enter info system respond jsn apxv namiaf apxv namiaf could different depending job attached help program look alot neater vt emulation type screen vt nt type bracket command refer enclosed bracket type help extensive tutorial list command best bet point buy quick reference guide campus going describe useful command mean batch subsystem usually subsystem like basic fortran etc  return batch mode typing batch usefull command catlist show permanant file directory enquire f display temporary file workspace limit display priveledges info get online help r reexecute last command get fn load fn local file area change change certain spec file permit allow user use one file rewind rewinds local file new fn creates new file purge deletes file list ffn list file uproc create autoexecute procedure file mail sendreceive private mail bye logoff use helpme cmd command exact syntax parameter command also several machine specific application program pascal fortran spitbol million others look info command  also text editor edit xedit fse full screen editor xedit easiest use telray terminal full documentation simply type xedit fn edit file fn special control character used cyber control control q work normally terminate character control followed carriage return wanted break autoexecute login program would hit cr fast repetitively order break batch subsystem control z used set environment variable execute special low level command example z tm cr terminate connection  thinking hell cyber good well wo nt phone company record ca nt get credit information one going tell crash since crashing system sin us cyber though one handy use set chat system normally  line going large university cyber system source chat program called communicator releasing soon another use kind underground information exchange people frequently set system easily done cyber procedure file procedure file similiar batch file msdos shell script unix make procedure file autoexecute using uproc command like uproc auto make file auto auto execute also special procedure file called procfile procedure may accessed simply front procfile read proc cn sample procedure catlistunetpdoc exit could simply type cn prompt would execute catlist command back uprocs could easily write whole bb procedure file say wanted run chat system want people change password account could proc chat pw  password  ife pw  cyber  yes chat revert bye else yes notewrong password try revert bye endif yes procedure ask user password nt type  cyber  logged get right dumped chat program soon exit chat program logged way user get batch subsystem change password otherwise screw around account following listing procfil use local system lot handy utility example    cut   proc b bye
