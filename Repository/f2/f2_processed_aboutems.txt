prepared john wilson hyperdyne inc annandale va beginning  beginning microprocessor defendably  first  microprocessor invented memory computer expensive could directly address thousand byte information great deal day system correctly system owner could afford actually place full k memory system thing changed quickly silicon valley guy learned make transistor smaller better became much economically feasible talk fully populated k machine software front thing like spreadsheet word processor invented program hungry memory microcomputer user rapidly outgrew k box going story little digression origin k limit limit direct result fact cpu chip address line address line set wire coming cpu allow cpu indicate item memory want read write computer size  piece  byte bit character wire called address bus voltage address line interpreted binary number first pin representing place second pin representing place third pin representing place etc resultant number address addressed cpu number distinct pattern thing two value raised th power number time quantity  k  early programmer engineer decided use  k  unit counting thing like memory nice power two figured close enough  real  thousand nobody would notice point story original microprocessor could address k simple reason address line nt build one address line well simple address line circuitry driving circuitry actually generate bit address circuitry decode new instruction would use bit circuitry made transistor unfortunately state art chip manufacturing allow chip built many transistor mankind waited silicon boy learn fit transistor one raisinsized chip meanwhile back ranch intel corporation stroke electromarketing genius took basic architecture doubled small portion internal working cpu address circuitry basically duplicated address register transistor hold pattern bit place address bus slid left bit added simple circuitry add arithmetically  old  address register born infamous intel segment register making simple kluge intel created microprocessor effectively twenty address line could therefore address th location little one million byte new unit called megabyte even away million  k  thousand bought  k  nt bit address bus allowed new amazing spreadsheet really amazing thing turn allowed intel beat competitor motorola marketplace expanding address bus  right  way family turn led ibm select intel family motorola basis new pc rest history using power microsoft corporation adapted cpm operating system new chip using new power created msdos lot reason msdos took world everyone happy except   programmer kept getting bold way found use memory user wanted still bigger spreadsheet started playing thing like cadcam dbms artificial intelligence desktop publishing etc insatiable appetite memory silicon boy kept hunger developing bigger better cpu etc bit address bus could therefore address mb memory directly one could possibly want put much actual memory pc right preemptive first strike also created bit address bus could therefore address byte billion byte pow bam take power user day finally come cpu sitting desktop could finally address memory anyone could afford buy      yes surviving significance today predecessor      end problem right wrong unfortunately million million bit machine mid probably significantly hundred million dollar invested msdos software know use new bit instruction capability especially msdos unix o number le well known operating environment use bit mode msdos still king intel wanted sell new chip wisely decided build  mode  new chip make compatible msdos mode essentially switch inside cpu turn another chip insofar logical functionality concerned running msdos shiny new still running bit address consequently mb address space mode called real mode lower mb addressable memory real mode called conventional memory solution em expanded memory specification expanded memory expanded memory way allow mb memory used msdos application cpu address million different address one mb pc answer cpu reuses address get one byte data allowing one address actually used reference several distinct physically different storage location one time course em memory usually resides special  em card  like ast  rampage  say usually clever way implementing em machine nt use  special  em card discussed later section entitled  software approach em  em card memory chip like regular system memory card difference memory chip card connected directly cpu address bus chip actually wired another address bus totally contained card address bit usually extra address bit come well passedthrough system address bit rest come special storage location onboard em card called page register page register loaded register directly addressable cpu access byte data em memory cpu first load page register simply another location accessible cpu make normal memory reference bit come address bus rest come bit previously squirreled away page register thus seen given

kb sized range address cpu address space several megabyte pagingin one chunk time  extended memory  actually extended memory much simpler concept remember unused address line msdos realmode application use first put decoration cpu put protected mode use extra address line address megabyte megabyte memory without needing help special em hardware like page register private emscard address

special program use extended memory may wish reserve part board memory use extended memory otherwise really good reason configuring memory em note em board generally expensive  plain  extended memory board additional circuitry required consult board user manual proper switch setting software setting give mix desire em card used machine usually found better cheaper way go discussed em emulator le common approach implementing em computer em emulator softwareonly approach requires special hardware use essentially turn extended memory expanded memory unfortunately price magic performance extended memory lack special hardware switch address like block memory em card software must copy whole block data kb worth back forth program extended memory every time new block required  even read single byte depending nature program time slower hundred time slower  true  em recommended solution reason however necessary used approach used machine extended memory machine based like original pc xt accommodate extended memory much better solution described extended memory manager built every special capability used excellent job providing em memory without use em hardware facility called paging unit memory management unit mmu mmu consists circuitry much like switching circuitry onboard em card except much sophisticated actually included use advanced operating system used quite nicely emulate em based do machine mmu like em emulator turn extended memory expanded memory softwareonly mean unlike emulator mmu conjunction piece software known extended memory manager emm suffer performance penalty fact usually faster true em card circuitry onboard cpu chip faster lowerclass machine usually use em card extended memory used often fast bit system memory rather cardbased memory slowed relatively slow io bus system definitely way go excellent emms include  tothemax  qualitas inc  qemm  quarterdeck system inc use emms need install configsys file like em card configure partition available system memory extended expanded memory consult user manual package using virtual memory manager virtual memory manager another softwareonly approach em function almost identically em emulator discussed except use system disk rather extended memory storage medium block memory copied program imagine excruciatingly slow use approach last resort
