original version nba jam snes favorite technique use turbo steal button time knock player knock follow land ball knocked away fell get chance get rejecting dunk best way reject duck basket player air nba jam te rejecting duck made much easier previous version reject dunker  percent time player high defensive power dunker going beat basket best method stopping knock leaf ground dunk reboundinggoal tending rebounding nba jam te hard remember two thing first rebound pick ball rim air problem powerup goal tending favorite powerup regular basis team score goal tending call secondly must first one jump get rebound basketball game jump player  strip  ball air  always first jump shot blocking shot blocking nba jam te hardest way defending outside shot good player like either knock player get shot trying reject closer basket offenseshooting strategy passing passing one best way keeping fom getting ball stolen pass must  smart  pass though best time pas getting trapped corner double teamed trap one favorite strategy among player start like shooting draw defender toward passing shot get often hanging air passing computer teammate knock opponet  pas quickly easy basket method drawing defense work wonder dunk stated earlier fairly easy reject dunk nba jam te defender position basket like use team good dunker good point shooter ill take dunker monster jam coming kick hot shooter happens free   drew defense away form dunkingpass dunkingpass done like shootingpass shooting nba jam te two way score shooting dunking stand reason lot chance making basket increase three condition met first get higher fg percentage get clean look basket shooting defender face unwise two reason probably miss shot shooting hand face might simply get blocked secondly shot likely go holding turbo button shooting b let go ball highest point jump pump fake good way throw defender especially good playing perimeter nt throw defender pump fake might try pressing shoot rapidly throw elbow might throw defender dunking favorite way scoring integral part nba jam experience stated earlier though much harder dunk te version previous one order dunk successfuly must beat defender basket nt order dunk must dunking someone little defensive power incredibly important notice opponet pick player selection screen milk clock oneplayer two person team v computer burn second clock keep lead changing quick play fast break basketball large lead computer assistance function nba jam te try rob well earned victory cheating like hell combat rebound inbound ball stay backcourt nba jam te give backcourt violation computer stay position nothing shot clock count force take move second quickly pas teammate open take shot even miss get better better shot rebounding get ball pas back man backcourt milk clock beware large lead fourth quater computer assistance could lose computer rampant cheating fire character make three consecutive shot row said  fire  future shot stand much improved chance entering basket although seen miss fire really open lead fire launching three three stay  fire  team make shot go basket fire try stay fire letting team make hoop basket goaltending also work  heating  e made two shot row need third go fire however would goaltend day need one basket go fire better try rebound let computer automatic basket everytime fire advantage unlimited turbo power even kind player hold turbo game nt stay fire forever lose period time rather long time seems usually point lose                                     special thanks                                     marty
