achieving controlled information processing environment instead executive action focus effective planning implementation ongoing review structure usually explicit group organization assigned specific responsibility providing daytoday guidance direction process within group information security manager ism identified permanent focal point information protection issue within agency ism must thoroughly familiar agency mission organization operation manager sufficient authority influence organization access agency executive issue require escalation independence determining reporting relationship ism independence functional area within agency desirable plan budget ism function approved agency management rather part functional area budget approach avoids conflict interest facilitates development maintenance comprehensive consistent protection program serf need agency management degree centralization desirability centralized versus decentralized security heavily debated largely depends size organizational structure management approach individual agency centralized approach security advantage directly responsive executive direction specifically accountable progress status decentralized approach security advantage close functional area involved long term decentralization may provide better integration security entity function effective combined approach offer advantage small dedicated resource agency level direct information protection program additional resource utilized functional area level implement program area dedicated staff common practice assigning responsibility information security existing staff major responsibility often unsuccessful least one dedicated staff member recommended program management level need additional fulltime resource depends agency computer environment number information system technical complexity degree networking importance information processed adequacy existing control extent agency dependence information system affect resource needed implementation stage development comprehensive information protection program practiced observed widely throughout federal agency occurs stage requires ongoing monitoring maintenance remain viable first organizational requirement information protection identified different agency varying level need security information protection program structured
