one nice thing registered wwiv modify source code heart content sysops modify board make wwiv easier use user modification spice board adding color ansi extensive routine decrease speed wwiv fairly large amount speed one wwiv strong point zygote term terminal program pdshareware market nt quite popular telix procomm gaining popu larity every day new version zygote contains new feature surpass term program many time best thing zygote special feature accessible wwiv bb board zygote would act terminal program would except feature found term program zygote used wwiv bb make use zygote feature however whole new realm bbsing entered zygotewwiv multitask chat first feature released wwiv currently come two chat mode standard twoway zygotewwiv multitask chat look much like twoway chat except chatting take place one half screen half normal bb function performed sysop user chatting either sysop user switch chat window bb window bb window function reading message listing file writing message moving sorting removing file editing user etc performed chat window remains intact especially useful want discus certain message look certain file chat something else chatter ramble version  modification released october version  scheduled released late december early january new feature still testing stage close release zygotewwiv binary screen feature modification give wwiv complete facelift part bb made fullscreen ansi picture regular terminal program wwiv would send ansi picture modem send code place prompt screen zygote wwiv simply tell binary screen ansi screen saved binary format display le second full screen ansi displayed end ready input positioning cursor still done wwiv take care since binary screen byte size several binary screen disk would consume large amount disk space either bb zygote user matching screen wwiv simply display screen normally albeit much slower speed binary screen display wwiv sysops see modification released module module contain documentation part board modify well standard wwiv binary screen first module leased logon message base binary screen custo mized time customizer must know position cursor make necessary change feature beginning series featues released zygote continues grow wwiv feature make time powerful term program bb zygote term miguel sanchez aka nguyen  netzip ii revision east bay ray many people seen network fidonet use compression make net packet smaller year help sea arc program pkware pkzip program wwivnet opportunity netzip written east bay ray provides network compression node wwivnet wwivlink idea new one wwivnet two previous try alph benny hill stopped strange bug would produce divide overflow computer system others east bay ray also previously stopped conflict wayne zip routine resulted lost mail last however version found worked installation netzip quite easy install batch file minimal work thoughtfully provided filo left running install create zipsysnet plain text file contains list node wish use netzip must also netzip installed using net simple netzip work internally netzip first take un compressed sxxxxnet file renames pnet file one higher last existing pnet file current archive add sxxxxzip sxxxxzip renamed sxxxxnet contactnet updated reflect adjusted size sxxxxnet file compressed wish see ratio compression view sxxxxnet pkzip pkunzip netzip excellent finally purged bug present previous version along stigma revision lost mail chance download share neighbor save lot transmission time long distance line save money also  thought multiline wwiv john wash input richi shinn get started please note article written response article like subject written jeff garzik originally appeared wwivnews vol issue first wholly agree jeff possible solution either make program singletasking multiuser run multitasking  optionally multiuser  envi ronment point though begin differ jeff lan would indeed expensive solution said  node pc  would slow one standard pc networking today novell netware distributedprocessing system lan implementation server system client system server control shared resource lan  storage printer modem etc  client workstation us resource  local hard drive local printer example multiline wwiv running novell netware environment sharing data file node storing server drive would noticeably slower individual pc running individual bbs  entire idea behind distributed processing part reason educated administrator choose netware networking solution rather package run server treat client system dependent rather autonomous entity must run pcdos possible multiple wwivs running concurrently jeff said  commercial multitasker  window  quarterdeck desqview however going individual copy wwiv sharing perhaps file transfer gfile section need done wwiv total rewrite wayne bell know hinted suggested would nt port wwiv unix stated would rewrite unix internal multinode capability would difficult implement handler processing io com port well console half battle remains however facility file record locking integral part almost multiuser system go extra step nt bother making wwiv multiline instead make wwiv support file record locking save oodles memory would nt allocate chunk store sub file dir file anything like wanted user record open userlst lock record read record unlock record close file wanted read message upload file anything requires file io would basically thing get file record locking working properly would need  make wwiv multiline bb   need copy mswindows  novell netware pcmos desqview good machine patience getting set opinion multiline system summing making wwiv talk several com port waste time worry file sharing set anyone would like discus file record locking future issue wwivnews drop note see author john wash professional unix zealot fulltime social irritant  bug main menu prompt dunghill fowl problem happens board access sub nt know board sub mod main menu prompt sub hit plus key instead going sub jump sub however hitting minus key sub bring sub example  fred fried fish sub  hitting plus sub  general message  skipped sub hitting minus key  underwater basket weaving  long lost sub ok nt big deal  occurs aforementioned sub number exactly easily spotted problem code notified wayne ed  pending file tip trick news wwivnews staff next wwiv release v released released time soon wayne set release date feature include batch uploads bimodem support complete rewrite modem handling routine several smaller feature information modem handling routine see earlier article issue wwivnet also new subslst coordinator receives new information sub sends regular subslstsubs update send email regarding sub list change intel offering sysop deal ex high speed modem v v vbis compatible connect standard v v modem speed  baud connect usr hst speed higher baud downside good deal ca nt afford usr d microcom  let buyer beware  charles boyer netedit v black dragon recently released fix potential bug v v annouced wwivnews make couple improvement v including handling net partial update technical correction one menu black dragon wwivnews competition wwivlink wwivlink distributes newsletter much like one called  link post  also made available board get new program netpurge go specified network pending data file default deadnet deletes nonemail return email type     originator extra line header telling originator type email sent undeliverable black dragon  letter editor wwivnews noted interest appearance wwivnewsnet data directory today interesting idea hope work benefit wwivnet sysops however couple suggestion distribution announce presence earthly idea wwivnews going distributed along update complaining suggesting flaunt little bit change name assume come month also assume volume change year mind perhaps suggest another naming convention fidonodeliststyle call wwivnews num num number day year issue released b another way going volume issue per volume use hexidecimal format example wwivnews would volume issue wwivnewsa would volume ah issue provide issue per volume wwivnewsaff volume ah issue ffh c yet another possibility nw volume issue wwivnews boil nt want lose wwivnews every time new one come make provision keep em rather copy em john wash excellent suggestion favorite idea overall naming wwivnewsvi v volume number hex issue number hex however stay way basically wayne already put code way reluctant change quickly birth however provide board back issue anyone collecting ed  official jargon random wayne allmail january couple thing wish removed distribution subboard please post message subboard correct thing email host sub inform himher way net apparently problem receiving net update precisely sure also happen net apparently nt would good idea use networkexe file net net fix problem january th also january th going multiple connect file addition connect file find connect connect file data directory exception connect group network continue function however affect anyone except gc maybe ac due way connection update handled required ac forward connection update gc able send connection update request directly reiterate anything network connection update bbslist update complaint etc correct order first contact ac gc finally nc unable resolve people come thing contacted gc simply referred back gc going directly tends slow thing speed starting wwiv v release date yet set month source code wwiv also distributed registered sysops certain select wwivnet system work like  wwivnet system selected source distribution point b make list based input registered wwiv user user system fact registered wwiv user user user able download source code wwiv system c sysops source distribution point special file transfer section wwiv source distribution file section specific dar user listed master list dar hence allowed download source code list look something like reg num account random random hector hector hector dude dude source distribution point step   selecting source distribution point registered wwiv sysop registered year wwivnet year would like source distribution point agree release source code user list please reply tell interested remember around  distribution point like various area country people reply rhode island one actually selected  editor corner east bay ray one several network sub investigate month  alternative sysop sub  sub type hosted john hardman send mail speed answering gc group boast le flame sysop sub check might make nice valentine gift observant people notice text
