muse scary music essentially human activity electronic equipment especially computer  mechanical   unnatural  throughout history however music closely linked technology except human voice instrument musicmaking always  hightech  time electronic muse          violin pipe organ trumpet complex construction  unnatural  first developed computer today piano saxophone vital element musical experience triumph manufacturing technology century ago musical instrument designer always employed advanced technology time time electronic computer technology preferred new musical instrument development say musician embracing electronics  latest thing  group musician favor instrument sound good b offer musically useful way manipulating sound increasingly musician drawn electronic instrument  easy play sound like traditional acoustic instrument offer new tone color new way making music musician experimenting electronic instrument ever since first vacuum tube invented threequarters century ago even musician musical instrument builder collaborating harness forerunner electronics computer service muse growing number musician computer technology greatest advance since invention catgut music form

musical otherwise vibration air rate roughly  time second vibration repeat regularly sound pitched like guitar clarinet tone sound vibration repeat regularly sound pitchless  noisy  like cymbal crash pitched sound rate repetition called frequency greater frequency higher musical pitch tone strength vibration called amplitude greater sound amplitude louder shape vibration called waveform think waveform sound graph air pressure particular point time waveform abstraction use describe sound happens n abstraction lot tone perceived quality loudspeaker speaker short device convert electronic vibration sound talking electronic music computer generally refer electrical waveform exist inside instrument circuitry refer waveform sound assume speaker somewhere using produce sound personal computer may contain small speaker eg apple may use speaker tv connected eg atari commodore may require connection external sound system like highquality music synthesizer electronic piano organ synthesizer use  analog  circuit produce smooth waveform digital computer circuit hand work switching computer produce musical tone computer turn speaker say memory location produce tone writing simple program turn speaker current b wait short time c turn speaker wait e repeat step specified number time waiting time determines pitch tone number cycle determines duration  speaker   speaker  time resultant waveform called square wave musical quality somewhat hollow like clarinet  speaker   speaker  time waveform called  rectangular  quality may saxophone oboelike  speaker   speaker  time programmed change randomly resultant sound pitchless noise computer produce square rectangular wave equipped sound synthesizer circuit produce complex waveform sound synthesizer built single integrated circuit chip programmed produce wide variety waveform envelope envelope sound outline build sustains dy synthesizer built circuit card plug computer may completely separate peripheral computer program enable musician design sound musician think type programming  building instrument   instrument  exist data define waveform envelope  may therefore stored  library  disk tape

converted digital analog form passed analog circuitry digital circuit produce waveform made step often audible method synthesis advantage limitation musician prefer smooth distortionfree analog waveform others favor accuracy versatility digital generator playing pc        simple program personal computer make scale melody computer speaker use typical program kind type code pitch duration note sophisticated program enable vary rectangular wave tone color adjust overall tempo produce trill glide store tune programmed disk cassette tape music maker software package apple produce illusion two note played simultaneously generates sound effect well musical tone display colorful animated video pattern time music program like music maker nt produce complex highquality tone main us educational recreational  learn good deal programming train ear lot fun small investment addition computer using computer builtin sound synthesizer adding digitally controlled synthesizer peripheral make music wide variety interesting tone color commodore one versatile builtin synthesizer currently available personal computer   us proprietary chip produce three tone programmable waveform envelope chip also contains analog filter device change tone color emphasizing sound overtone cutting others resulting range quality sound rival analog keyboard synthesizer available musical instrument store musically advanced computer program designed around mountain computer musicsystem eightvoice digital tone generator apple among popular alpha syntauri soundchaser system use musicsystem combination professionalstyle four fiveoctave music keyboard operating software either system make sound play music keyboard record keyboard performance since one part software set musicsystem produce desired tone color another part capture store keyboard performance play back keyboard performance variety tone color pitch range speed alpha syntauri soundchaser implement basic function multitrack recording studio record keyboard performance one  track  play track back recording subsequent track syntauri metatrak program instance let record sixteen track play back simultaneously fast forward rewind
