right fortier never told fbi cased building h somewhere r mean passing oklahoma city casing building h warmer r fortier told fbi oklahoma city way kansa went federal building looked something like h something like r never real admission planning blow building h need read fortier confession printed daily oklahoman r fortier prosection big witness never confessed saying even close h even close r prosecution nt need gain indictment mcveigh want fortier witness actual trial big time statement far south confession ca nt really use trial h use say wo nt make impression juror could tip scale gullible juror r fbi spent time pressuring hell fortier  h important see obviously best could stayed long nothing better fortier involvement bombing minimal waste time fbi man charge would made one run fortier forgotten r word never confessed casing building mcveigh medium completely exaggerated fortier mcveigh driving oklahoma city way kansa passed federal building something like medium stretched h something like r fbi spent much time pressuring fortier link mcveigh bombing nothing better h nothing better r feel mcveigh linked bombing h yes fbi relied man fortier really could nt provide anything important need remember important r say know ca nt specific exactly happened inside grand jury seem saying fbi used poor source gain indictment mcveigh h yes r seems part pattern h damn right r example judging arrest warrant mcveigh issued fbi april rely unnamed witness saw mcveigh scene bombing witness found miraculously mcveigh arrest st extremely quick work one guy saw police artist sketch mcveigh tv came forward h guy r saying none witness name released read piece book  april st man used work mcveigh called fbi seen artist sketch tv said mcveigh rightwinger army one point gone waco look ruin branch davidian compound mcveigh upset happened federal agent done man gave fbi address stockton hill road kingman arizona  h laugh artist sketch even arrest mcveigh r must psychic h yes psychic r mean probable fbi using extremely thin pretext accusing mcveigh h definitely r yet mcveigh involved h right whole point example various surveillance videotape bombing tape say southwestern bell journal record building across street nt know showed detail bombing including perpetrator possible none material shown u grand jury r none h zero r possibility tape showed federal building collapsing shape collapse could make clear truck bomb real device caused major damage building instead interior charge placed column job easy see look like demolition building collapsing seen hundred time television h yes r grand jury indicts mcveigh evidence brought forward fbi indictment extremely thin purpose feel mcveigh definitely involved bombing fbi held back didnt provide real evidence grand jury h saying r know witness building collapsing april h r man named peter schaffer long bombing spoke reporter daily oklahoman newspaper ann defrange said man named peter schaffer told seen building collapse top would classic implosion signifying charge placed inside building column spoke schaffer denied seeing building fall got back defrange remained definite schaffer told nt budge h fbi must gotten know fbi able get witness shut important thing know talked people certain instance witness believe concealing evidence right thing really believe fbi sold bill good national security something like case fbi used straightout intimidation witness size people one witness use something like national security another go intimidation r got attempt fbi prosecution indict mcveigh grand jury without introducing evidence could somehow damaging prosecution case h exactly r fbi stick thin evidence ignores solid evidence solid evidence contains uncomfortable information could somehow link government bombing h sure r truck bomb could nt caused major damage federal building indicates presence professional participant planted charge inside building fbi prosecution grand jury ignore nt want bring simply focus mcveigh nichols one else concentrate fortier browbeat still get nothing substance h right second conversation heidelberg december reviewed material michael fortier indictment fortier apparently state star witness mcveigh he shaky star reading pleabargained charge finally drawn fortier formally filed august clear never told fbi mcveigh  cased federal building  prior april bombing fortier said mcveigh simply drove oklahoma city way kansa passed federal building daily oklahoman state mcveigh point  pointed building bombing target  remains seen rate car trip kansa actually took place december four month bombing federal prosecutor joseph hartzler according daily oklahoman august  noted fortier charged conspirator bombing said government evidence participated conspiracy  fortier charged knowledge mcveighnichols bomb plot fact also charged keeping knowledge fbi also charged helping transport stolen firearm bomb across state line heidelberg said arriving plea bargain fbi investigator put  huge houraday pressure fortier several month time fortier attorney one advise fortier could absolutely walked experienced  said heidelberg appear possible fortier admission charge finally filed government compromise downward favor instead result pressure exerted upward speak toward culpability part mr jones mcveigh attorney real desire represent client fortier look like could come apart crossexamination charge filed fortier made scare tactic forced exaggeration fbi dissected stand fortier called star witness could admit  prior knowledge bombing plot  really nonexistent example reality heard conversation mcveigh  possibility  definite plot fortier come apart crossexamination could create psychological window opportunity incourt even outofcourt introduction evidence showing wider conspiracy mcveigh patsy dupe mr jones seem like lawyer risk career fully armed defense client mcveigh usual leaf outmoded objective like honesty questioning authority digging truth private citizen welcome america obviously heidelberg leading conclusion kind evidence fbi using case kind ignoring seemed saying fbi used thinnest pretext get indictment mcveigh nichols holding back kind evidence could implicate government bomb plot nailed first interview felt grasp maybe simple nt seeing started second conversation talking mcveigh sister jennifer hoped would get stark understanding fbi prosecution really manipulation evidence eventually simple truth quite shock r medium bypass article said fbi put lot pressure mcveigh sister like fortier started strongly defending brother ended witness mean sister testifying brother h fbi sat mcveigh sister mother impression fbi took somewhere pressure mcveigh sister nice person fbi pressure effective conscience turn around person conscience r mcveigh sister say mcveigh told worked special operation army group engaged criminal activity h exactly said something like r brother told special operation group existed h yes r recruited turned h yes r nt testify grand jury h wo nt talk nt know happy martyr confident wo nt get convicted nt seem terribly worried seems possible think working government therefore wo nt convicted speculation r mcveigh behavior inconsistent combat score soldier top percent said obvious officer material smart say purchased  pound ammonium nitrate left fingerprint receipt day bombing registered dreamland motel kansa real name drive away federal building april mercury marquis license plate get stopped state trooper outside town arrested ninety minute bombing h yes r unless drug addict drunk h druggytype friend particular evidence addict lot druggy friend though r one possibly steve colbern police custody since last may reportedly found speed lab back colbern trailer h even mcveigh deliver ryder truck nt think destruction building would significant  conned  still enough convict chance remainder building still standing bombing could prove really destroyed demolition charge placed interior column forensic evidence left government demolished rest federal building may would big job sell multiple bomb theory jury public nt bomb expert understand pattern damage could nt fit one bomb r mcveigh nt really understand parallel operation secret interior charge placed inside building planned go simultaneously truck bomb h mcveigh nt know extent damage done taking heat think would killed dangerous possible revelation trial r mention would part government let get back john doe prosecution manipulates evidence completely excluding whole idea john doe grand jury nt right h yes exclusion pointed r mean pointed h laugh r nt ask bomb expert h eventually brought one nt count fact anyone grand jury could spot guy cia type operator found later cia although lot impressive credential testimony effective whole thing bogus dog pony show hypothetical want convince someone anfo ammonium nitrate plus fuel oil powerful show film truck blow hell say used five pound anfo could grand juror sure five pound demonstration prosecution used like obviously dupe unsophisticated audience grand jury easy see r feel first got grand jury h nt go trying cause trouble tried get along nt wanting kicked grand jury wanted hang longer turn would nt heard oklahoma city anyway done r attention mainstream press good morning america today show h everybody interviewed want turn nut nt come way nt print interview nt story r nt story example h new york time contact time newsweek cbs nt want give stature supposed  dateline whole bunch appearance good morning america today show ignored even governor oklahoma frank keating calling nut nt work people know invited mansion nt go r many uninterviewed people story h would seem rescue worker found unexploded bomb federal building got somebody know  nt hoax found two bomb nt explode somebody somewhere verify  yeah found bomb reported gave whoever  r unless told shut unless manipulation evidence h yeah even grand jury witness could see nt remember everything remembered memory deteriorated laugh fbi people  remembering would counterproductive investigation patriotic duty forget  got hear tape interview secret witness occasionally witness already influenced fbi take tremendous amount get tell really know think screw government investigation real witness medium found ided mcveigh bombing scene nt show grand jury explain absence dog pony show prosecution spent lot money bringing witness knew nothing bombing many witness need bring say mcveigh gun show ten witness irrelevant many people go gun show nt blow building prosecution grand jury point juror asking  gun show legal u  witness used get across idea mcveigh went gun show bad guy heard nothing real witness saw mcveigh crime scene nt amazing get people buy story without one bit evidence association alone get believe said witness testimony got pretty much baloney didnt give u real stuff real witness r getting back implying first interview telling witness saw mcveigh driving truck vicinity federal building morning bombing testified grand jury h right think witness saw people mcveigh people might able tie crime government people  r government informant agent h yeah r well saying fbi us incredibly thin evidence keep back real witness could tie fraction faction government bombing h know saying among lawyer  get ham sandwich indicted  ham probably little sour guy restaurant died must eaten sandwich poisoned never tell grand jury died car accident left restaurant bring lot lot witness saw ham tasted ham say ham little bit funny color nt quite right tasted little weird r right see getting staggering mean bunch witness real witness saw mcveigh scene bombing people john grand jury nt call show surveillance videotape instead browbeat fortier someone say could walked completely absolutely minimal involvement mean grand jury supposed place crime looked h nt keep evidence understand ask would present stupid form nonevidence gain indictment mcveigh keep good stuff ask see going r concealment evidence john doe kept suspect john kept somehow perpetrator would make uncomfortable government would open case area area showing government involvement h think another reason prosecution would withhold persuasive witness people really scene bombing r ca nt h mcveigh cooperating lawyer r mean h saying people involved r tell talking fair number involved people h well think five actually witness report count two men pickup three men mcveigh car maybe even two ryder truck possibility two ryder truck r mcveigh wo nt say h good soldier think willing take fall r good soldier h think holding sister jennifer talk something bad happen also suspect think working government r possibly recruited people said patriot h yeah r  patriot  could told  connected good people inside corrupt government washington people still want save country ultimate employer  h yeah would work mcveigh flag apple pie business r
