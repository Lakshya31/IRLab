creative lab inc popular accessory found many ibm pc compatible computer system although board usually used provide music sound output computer game also support audio input computer standard soundblaster support mono audio io available price range pro model support stereo add cdrom scsi interface cost around dollar board digitize sound high speed using one computer dma direct memory access channel transfer sound sample directly computer memory memory sound sample written disk ability digitize record sound enables soundblasters used reception decoding apt satellite signal output radio receiver tuned apt signal hz audio tone satellite scan earth cloud varies amplitude tone proportion brightness area currently observing    viewed content voc sample file produced soundblaster vrec program favorite image processing program would look like weather satellite photo voc file like exposed roll film content must first  developed  view image process  devloping  voc file content weather satellite image called demodulation demodulation convert recorded value sample hz apt sine wave corresponding pixel value desired image pixel value actually represent amplitude peak apt sine wave signal signal sampling theory state anything meaningful digitally sampled signal must sample signal least twice fast highest frequency component signal hz apt signal need sampled least time second apt signal constant tone freqency component much beyind hz also law thermodynamics life say nothing perfect theory predicts really need sample higher rate sample apt signal exactly time hz carrier frequency ie sample per second input sample eactly degree  phase apart adjacent sample using following trigonometry identity turn particularly easy accurately demodulate apt sample co x sin x sin x sin x co x co x substituting first equation last equation get sin x sin x sin x sin x recorded sample hz apt sine wave degree apart next sample calculate pixel value pixel sqrt sample sample sample sample demodulation program need read voc sample file throw away file header information adjust sample clockdma rate error dc offset calculate pixel value adjacent pair sample value scale result value finally write resulting pixel value image file could time consuming process consider typical minute capture million input sample multiple add square root operation take lot cpu time particularly true floating point arithmetic used make demodulation program run quickly table possible combination adjacent bit sample value precomputed according formula demodulation software order convert recorded apt sample pixel value look proper table entry time consuming floating point arithmetic need used demodulator table built reading writing megabyte file always time consuming process always reading writing sample image file multiple byte demodulation software take full advantage behavior do file system    problem problem problem although soundblaster quite good adding little zip odd computer game far precision signal processing system using soundblaster card apt reception present many problem fortunately software technique may used overcome problem yield apt image rival best commercial system using soundblaster apt demodulation present two main type problem sample inaccuacies offset clock rate missing sample error sampling perfect sine wave perfect board perfect world yield series sample average sample value zero unfortunately soundblaster circuitry usually add small dc offset recorded sample value dc offset cause noise  beat  pattern appear demodulated image file remove effect dc offset sample value demodulation software calculates average sample value block input sample sample bias subtracted input sample demodulation program currently bit paranoid thing recalculates sample bias input block would bit faster calculate value first block input level soundblaster board properly adjusted sample value offset seem change block easy demodulation apt signal need sample sample per second resulting image properly synchronized satellite data need exactly sample per second precisely exactly sample per second exact typical fourteen minute satellite pas requires accuracy around one part per million   sample per second typically satellite scan one line pixel every  second line per minute sample rate sample per second minute satellite pas generates megabyte data sample clock rate accurate mere one part per million resulting image skewed pixel top bottom although pixel skew across screen pixel line  percent skew noticeable looking wanting quantitative analysis satellite orbit doppler bow accurate soundblaster clock ask turn closest set sample rate around sample per second  accuracy around one part hundred  even close make matter worse clock two soundblaster board easily differ part per thousand clock error magnitude cause image appear like tv set lost sync image unreadable mess slanted bar dma circuitry soundblaster board automatically transfer block signal sample computer memory without using cpu time block sample dmaed memory recording software start dmaing next block sample another memory area second block sample received recording software writes first block computer hard disk process alternate pingpong fashion reading sample one buffer writing buffer data disk unfortunately signal sample lost time end one dma block startup next dma block make matter worse number sample lost depends computer system cpu type clock rate faster system loose fewer pixel block also number pixel lost seems depend upon whether block odd even numbered block fortunately possible compensate error clock rate sample lost dma block demodulation program compensates pixel lost betwwen dma block duplicating last sample dma block user independently specify number sample add even remove odd even numbered dma block e command line parameter sample clock rate error compensated two stage first stage coarse adjustment factor factor cause every nth input sample removed duplicated throwing away every st sample sample per second soundblaster produce cut sample per second coarse adjustment factor changed using c command line parameter second clock rate adjustment factor fine tuning factor used zero exact timing value adjusts residual skew image caused variation individual soundblaster board clock generator fine adjustment factor work like coarse adjustment factor cause every nth input sample removed duplicated may specified f command line parameter               first step connect satellite receiver microphone input soundblaster must careful set amplitude receiver output low enough overdrive soundblaster overdrive card automatic gain control agc circuitry attempt compensate cause streaking resulting image properly set receiver level use vedit program supplied soundblaster card select scan input item record menu show graphical representation input signal monitoring good satellite pas adjust receiver level none signal peak touch top bottom margin graph leave little safety margin  inch safe receiver level set next step record satellite pas disk done vrec program supplied soundblaster card soundblaster pro use command vrec c cap mic mono f low l c cap name file want write sample remember sample file quite large around kb per minute recording case sample written file c capvoc mic selects microphone input mono selects mono recording f low set lowpass recording filter set recording sample rate sample per second note ask value le vrec program round value around sample per second smallest value actually selects sample clock greater hz l set microphone level full open use receiver output level control adjust recording level nt think necessary left early attempt get rid hum image caused bad cable say record second minute value adjusted whatever length desired satellite pas recorded written disk voc sound sample file next step demodulate voc sample file image file use command sbdsp c capvoc c capimg read recorded sample file c capvoc write resulting image file c capimg remember file megabyte specify output file name demodulation program ask ok write output image data voc file time
