language statement function basic element c program indeed basic element almost programming language statement defined statement  set instruction make one unit computer program  unit put together make function c function named subroutine called part program function made statement grouped together accomplish specific task might sound little confusing think robot give instruction instruction might include go store purchase milk come home pour glass milk instruction would represent function robot programming specifying input order robot perform task however give precise instruction first function  go store  may made following instruction robot understand go door b open door c walk door go sidewalk e walk third st f turn left function comprised many smaller instruction computer understand even sophisticated robot may directly understand  go door  used instructional purpose understand idea related statement sequenced together function statement represent part program actually perform operation function structure c statement separated semicolon   language like basic fortran line ended endofline newline character line interpreted literally c structured language pascal modula etc semicolon mark end one statement mean one statement spanning several physical line several statement one line doesnt matter compiler recognizes semicolon statement separator function basically follow form functionname statement sequence function name represents actual name function statement sequence may one statement function may named anything wish except following condition function may name c reserved word see chapter name must comprised upper lower case letter digit  score   compiler additional restriction requiring function name longer character also note c case sensitive language mean function name function function technically two different function far compiler see try however use function name meaningful long  defacto  standard c programming use lowercase function name underscore separating word example functionone myfunction displaytopscores case wondering parenthesis following function name required later learn parameter argument may passed function passing function parameter leave parenthesis empty c defines word  parameter  called  void  use convention whenever declare function note also function c return value type caller may integer floating point real number character number different thing care function returning call  void function  take look three example function declared would properly redeclare void functionone void void myfunction void void displaytopscores void mean declaring three function take parameter argument care value function return seems confusing nt worry mean want function perform action modify return value need help concept please post question  learning c  subbase c program may many different function must one particular function main main first function c look begin program execution function statement c enclosed within code block code block designated beginning end brace     respectively know little programming think open brace   begin statement counterpart close brace   end statement become apparent start writing small program library function familiar basic know basic statement print goto input built language c however control statement external library function mean import somewhere else order c use c built io control tell c compiler look control function one common library function printf function similar basic print statement display data screen example valid use printf function printf  c fun  note string c treated array character must enclosed quote printed course semicolon necessary end statement get function somewhere else get well use c include directive specify header file get function common header file stdioh abbreviation  standard input output  function header file c compiler contains prototype term learn later great deal c input output function concern stdioh tell c read data found stdioh issuing preprocessor directive like include  stdioh  note preprocessor directive take place actual code program compiled directive statement function end semicolon know may seem bit awkward get used basically tell compiler get information need use input output function one nice thing c nt specify function want example modula import every single function need like inout import writestring writeint writecard writeln readcard opinion unnecessary work programmer part computer make life easier tie u kind busy work oh note stdioh directive either uppercase lowercase lowercase traditional method however nt matter actual do filename one note c part ignores space carriage return newlines little picky preprocessor directive thats nt care put curly brace function name whatever relation line matter coding standard use standard think look best make program easiest read free wish would suggest copying standard closely possible example two program identical far compiler see display greeting today screen first program listing definitely easier read  listing one  include  stdioh  void main void printf  greeting  printf  today   listing two  include  stdioh  void main void printf  greeting  printf  today  two quick note first comment thing enclosed   comment compiler totally ignores used primarily make code easily readable someone else later date make difference program second note always put include statement code tutorial understand library function nt need include directive save typing using turbo c get  prototype found  errorwarning compiling probably mean forgot include header file move cursor function whose prototype missing press ctrlf turbo c display parameter function tell header file contained create first program already written one small program  greeting  program run compile suggest using compiler turbo c use integrated development environment come excellent editor much offer free however use kind ascii text editor send code compiler explained documentation compiler basically three kind file need worry time source file source code program type give source file  c  extension nt worry though c intelligent enough require unlike modula requires source file mod extension c extension matter tradition header file already talked header file basically file list library function prototype writing header file later know need import io function executable file compile program successful ie error receive executable file version program run do exe extension  runtime  version program addition c compiler actually think make file obj extension type file called object file basically lowlevel version machine code translated exe version nt worry nt need keep around ie exe file enough run nt necessarily delete either unless crunching space hard drive promised program type program exactly appears editor compile produce following screen greeting c fun learn sum  program testc  include  stdioh void main void printf  greeting  printf  c fun learn nn  printf  sum    end program testc  learn  let explain two concept yet touched upon regarding printf save two concept chapter leave hanging give taste come first concept called backslash character constant c certain character represent unprintable character list follows code meaning   b backspace f form feed n newline r carriage return horizontal tab  double quote single quote  null character  backslash character v vertical tab alert bell octal constant x hexadecimal constant eventually learn take look one used example n newline constant cause printf basically execute newline almost hit enter addition n get rid overtyping like modula would type writestring  whatever  writeln accomplish thing c printf  whatevern  see significance let take look another backslash character constant  constant print quote sign inside quote example want print following  come  mary said would use printf   come  mary said  see easy basically use  print quote symbol necessary else compiler would think ending quote instantly  example printf   come  mary said  compiler yell use character constant make formatting lot easier c language let programmer bos second concept pulled use printf format code look line printf  sum     format code tell compiler  put integer value  integer value supplied comma second parameterargument printf easier example digest printf    simply print screen sending two argument printf  string say  put integer value screen   integer value want use multiple format code printf statement printf  plus equal  print plus equal screen parameter taken left right needed course integer format code one learn eventually code meaning   u unsigned decimalinteger x hexadecimal print sign p pointer string character octal decimal integer e scientific notation f
