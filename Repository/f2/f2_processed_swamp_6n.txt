explanation usually never encountered science always loophole flaw design  immutable  law first problem bc story two men could made british circle agriglyphs addition would way made circle part world problem claim easily circumvented noting bc two army hoaxer might work might also explain characteristic circle vary somewhat site next question addressed whether bc really made circle problem trivial

quick response medium time nearly everyone viewed single agriglyph made bc front camera agreed site sloppy  suspicious  although number circle claimed made bc started figure pared reasonable even figure seems bit high might possible allow bc lot energy several year work technique national geographic explorer tv show november hoaxer shown take considerable planning order produce complex complete darkness camera done bc even seen chance witness cerealogist called opinion dubbed hoax without much delay source story bit problem well tabloid initially broke hoax story earlier ran story suggested ancient sumerian communicating human circle investigation cerealogists found story generated  public relation  firm called maiden bridge farm mbf operated husband wife unlisted telephone
