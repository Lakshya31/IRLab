 forget password absolutely way retrieve document  pretty impressive actually could crack password word perfect x file   x  sheet paper simple counting file safe bennet originally discovered file encrypted bergen caelli determined information regarding version x taken paper extended written program extract password file nt care theory skip next section program stupid stupid stupid                                       word perfect allows add password file save encrypted requires password uncrypt word perfect encrypts file method two exclusive or first take length password plus increment character wrapping incrementing sequence xored text encrypted secondly password repeatedly xored block plaintext size password simple example say password  bone  incrementing sequence would start one number character bone bone hexidecimal f e text h e l l c c f sequence password f e f                result f c also store bit checksum computed following checksum character password rotate checksum right one bit xor character high bit checksum method encryption worked well word perfect x actual text thing encrypted determine password used would determine character length easy would take lot compuuting power basically brute force trying different password correct checksum thoughtful leave however someone dumb thing extended scheme word perfect x incorrectly word perfect x encrypt file encrypts information constant file file certain byte guaranteed always total byte never seem change mean known plaintext encrypted text method encryption regular simple method reverse encryption method find password password repeatedly applied text check say trying password length know incrementing sequence must start  xor first encrypted byte known value byte get back character might first character password check move byte since repeat increment sequence number repeat character password first got could password reality easy known byte spread password length letter ca nt figure anything expect stay constant change mess thing first problem solved one missing character since wp nice include checksum try possible value missing character checksum match second problem deal trying get five complete version password length different section known info run  vote  see well charcter agrees overall confidence level length threshold explore shown also know certain password value forbidden namely anything lower case character translated upper case help pare choice one missing character possible long password character person running program figure could possibly  imprtant repot    missing character  important report  obvious people method flexible seems get password easily anything really strange caught flexible threshold program                                        know people going instantly accuse writing tool hacker steal confidential data however seen many people asking recover locked file  forgot password  losing many hour think plenty legitimate use algorithm cracking program available quite time automated filling blank anyone thought file safe encrypted like fooling fooled claim made encryption say every tool potential abuse idea save file forgotten password wpcrack also purely technical interest value watching easily crack wp file even mhz xt unnerving algorithm really nt take much processing power use                                        syntax wpcrack filename threshold parameter filename word perfect file crack threshold percentage confidence threshold length considered possibility vary always best default ca nt get password file know protected lower threshold garbage sort get something switch normally wpcrack print character print actual character unfortunately control character allowed password strange thing screen output switch print decimal value character line pretty may option find character really force wpcrack print answer table form rather using special display password one missing character see let see possible password note wpcrack spit quite bit output might consider redirecting output file adding  filename  end line go fast send output file edit print whatever want example wpcrack myfilewp outputtxt view print outputtxt result                                        wpcrack check file password length currently generate five password length le larger password byte work total decides closely guess agree chose wrong length would expect different guess almost random length correct almost agree wpcrack weight result length get  confidence level  compare threshold threshold automatically discarded longer figure anything remaining length sorted confidence level highest lowest length following done crackwp check see many missing letter position password absolutely guess missing character missing character wpcrack tried every combination possible character position determines checksum combination match checksum stored file print password file correct password  pas  see pas  good checksum one missing character one missing character wpcrack make use checksum stored file generates every combination known character password work backwards checksum figure character must character legal character password resulting password printed file correct password  bigpassword  might see bigpasswo missing character extrapolated checksum bigpassword  good checksum missing character table mode one missing character nt anything except show possibility let superior text recognition system head see recognizes anything reasonable addition letting wpcrypt run nt produce desired result let bypass extra processing straight possibility format password table length match primary guess pas checksum good  primary guess  mean character best guess position number number occurences character example place wpcrack attempted determine first character password  p  turned time   turned second position time number time per character varies known byte evenly distributed case checksum primary guess matched show case multiple character possibility one position see something like password length confidence level match primary guess fwiin e incomplete match alternate z case three character clue one zero primary guess another line count character possibility first character password equally likely  f   z  useful useful result might something like force table mode match primary guess hella checksum bad match alternate case three time last character turned   twice     correct letter apparently would spell  hello  table mode let see although  missing character  display picked  hello  correctly well sure good use  nifty leave make good safety net note                                        longer password used le chance determining luckily people nt use password greater character crackwp get anything le crackwp ca nt figure shown password figure might able something shown like crossword puzzle byte assumed constant change thing get hairy contortion voting table display etc unless change really drastic crackwp able find anyway suggest folk word perfect use different method version  product really bad insecure good u forget password bad someone think data safe nt tried
