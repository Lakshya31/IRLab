well least one  bubble bubble wo nt run hack without upgrade cpu board upgrade quick easy best wo nt interfere older game nt already modified joust robotron machine play joust robotron stargate time hack turn back file give fourth game bubble previous conversion section labeled  tech note  primarily people want know hack work designed interested building unit skim section ingredient       working joust robotron machine hacked play joust robotron stargate per earlier conversion hack set control robotron already due previous hackery eprom n faster eprom n faster cmos ram chip rare ram chip work pin dip socket also need eprom programmer friend one binary dump bubble rom soldering iron detailed instruction            read instruction begin fairly simple upgrade nt take hour start finish good luck create program rom data file  read bubble rom store data disk reading rom make sure programmer set correct chip type long get data rest doesnt matter  create dummy file hex ffs byte long call

ca nt use hack sorry   sound board us probably program missing game wired adaptor hacked game play robotron stargate joust read bubble sound data create  bubblessnd  file new bubble sound rom fry rom  burn content  bubble   burn content  bubblessnd  okay got chip got bit work left bubble run plug chip power thing see appears normal powerup sequence couple encouraging text message brief flash color game reset deal editor note whole section basically extended tech note probably worth reading get feel trying accomplish  deal robotron joust used k cmos ram organized kbybit block bubble hand used full eight bit data bus requiring second cmos ram chip cool part plunking second chip make bubble happy none earlier game depended older ram architecture completely transparent go board ask use  well like like ram already got pinout new ram chip going install save lot wiring sticking new chip directly top old one yeah   upper bit data bus okay bend pin away body old chip hook em data bus somewhere else like like l two inch away two ram chip sound cool start bout safety precaution going soldering wire chip socket directly onto existing chip cpu board best result  tin lead  wire pin existing chip best done briefly touching soldering iron leg chip question touching solder nowheated chip leg risk run may overheat chip maximum safety thing one leg time random order around chip wait second leg let thing cool bit tinning solder anything remove three battery clip remember messing around powered chip usually bad idea cmos ram powered time battery final precaution may wish remove cpu chip two video decode rom begin video decode rom difficult impossible replace die close area circuitry youll working better safe sorry identify chip locate chip c g robotron joust cpu board chip c something ending

normally go bubble minute notice problem work backwards disconnect four wire see fix thing chance either shorted something stray glob solder gone fried cmos ram  game power behaves erratically odds fault lie cmos ram game appears dead world evidence cpu activity whatsoever  check solder glob first last resort replace chip odds problem arising procedure slim always careful soldering directly motherboard three older game work fine power back insert ram chip swap bubble rom power verify bubble function normally something go wrong almost certainly bad solder joint nt shorted anything vital game work fine neither good contact newlyexpanded ram bubble depends finally verified bubble running make sure three game function normally new ram system problem four game stage control panel okay run bubble console heck actually play game well pretty easily hacked machine play joust stargate robotron pleased note robotron almost compatible bubble live starting player game player start button vice versa youre done really feeling masochistic build quick adaptor swap pin p p start button use robotron panel asis record pinouts two interface board  robotron interface board pinout p fire left p

completely transparent respect older game difference run four game cabinet instead three substituted place cmos ram extension recommend replacing battery may draw much power drain battery quickly practical value nt hard data left battery system day completed hack anyone us battery let know turned add info document troubleshooting         safety check check everything short etc  powering go look little bit solder went wrong place strand wire anything could cause trouble got multimeter continuity checker use five minute spend may save hour debugging later see section additional debugging tip pertaining wiring solder short good luck switching game wait least  second switching chip power supply still supply enough power damage chip yank em early yes could always burn another set take chance changing control panel adaptor changing chip good way make habit automatic  time changed panel adaptor safe swap eprom sound check get sound playing bubble check rom ive seen least one set bubble rom incompatible one version bubble sound chip mileage nt vary nt surprised
