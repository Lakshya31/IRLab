password difficult guess easily sometimes might get overconfident remember story stanford  someone asked large cheese would let know operator password said  operator password currently unavailable  guy tried  currently unavailable  password got reminds time got real bug system  head crash caused ant disk platter general top limit number login attempt keep record bad try however difficult local

activate privilege anything want cover track deactivate without user ever wiser get wheel user run program wrote game small utility  limit particular create new username make wheel simply ask system outright someone password mistaken requires access top programming manual necessary material available line actually conceal creation far know  maybe sophisticated enough knowledge could make immediately apparent  anyway get far probably keep one step ahead  erase new account use password old one  change wheel password lot regular user wo nt change time  could even lock operator system changing password crazy enough perhaps forcing shut machine regain control might even restore stuff tape backup even nt wedge way secret stuff top system fun explore much novicefriendly system much
