never used computer welcome computer around since chinese abacus stay certain feel flow logic directs activity electronically computer work one using called microcomputer due size larger computer include minicomputer mainframe computer ram  think computer human brain brain memory sponge contains lifetime memory cause u act react based input input come via sens see smell steak burning grill input know react based previous experience memory go eat computer brain comprised large memory area called random access memory ram calculating portion called central processing unit cpu cpu ram work together computer  brain  day start computer one first task fill ram instruction give ability perform work work may creation document tracking accounting data information cpu found hardware section control instruction go computer brain control set experience provide computer ram computer evaluate input many device react typical input device keyboard type command computer evaluates based set instruction within ram follow action perhaps print document calculate send information telephone line later point may empty computer brain install different set instruction thus giving different ability unlike human computer requires electricity keep information within ram time computer turned information within ram lost ram temporary memory save instruction use later date storage device required computer use many device computer us floppy disk andor hard disk similar disk   think disk cassette record information cassette replayed indefinitely desired recorded floppy hard disk operate similar fashion record save something created like document onto disk hour day month later able play back retrieve document computer alter print like cassette floppy hard disk require electricity retain information hard disk floppy disk similar hard drive larger capacity file storage faster le likely fail due protected environment within operate ram called volatile memory electricity requirement floppy hard disk called nonvolatile memory retain information without aid electricity computer system includes computer hardware software people computer device capable solving problem manipulating data accepting data performing prescribed operation data displaying result hardware versus software             hardware physical equipment electronic magnetic mechanical device monitor keyboard printer microchip board  includes inputoutput device allow operator communicate computer vice versa software set program stored set instruction govern operation computer system make hardware run program instruction tell hardware perform particular task word processing game database management etc software refers instruction used enable otherwise dead machine understand input transform desired output computer hardware personality determined software word processing software turn computer word processor accounting software turn computer accounting tool etc computer requires two type software do disk operating system application software word processing spreadsheet game database management accounting payroll etc do disk operating system  computer require operating system one ibm pc use referred do sound like floss do software allows terminal printer computer mass storage system floppy disk work together unit control execution program also allows perform housekeeping chore regard managing disk file therefore do link hardware enables file management proper handling disk disk need care             never touch mylar surface bend disk always store protective sleeve hold disk label part sleeve avoid bringing disk near magnet tv telephone  leave hot cold area radiator cardash car winter etc use felt tip pen possible labeling ball point crease mylar note writeprotect notch disk covered tape nonexistent data  written  disk however data still  read  disk good idea always save data program two separate disk case one destroyed even cautious care delicate floppy disk sometimes fail apparent reason history first computational device abacus continuous use thousand year pascal adding machine developed mechanical device laid groundwork today odometer gas meter saw many machine developed controlled punch card weaving loom etc theoretical basis electronic circuitry developed mid first electronic computer developed iowa state college point forth numerous first computer became le mechanical smaller faster cheaper ibm began dominating computer market mid still today mainframe large computer installation market digital equipment corp dec became significant competitor mid dec generally considered technically better faster smaller etc ibm still fraction total market due marketing snafu today cray supercomputer fastest world manufactured wisconsin set vat liquid helium increase conductivity faster operation time v speed method calculation approximate speed human manual calculation second burroughs e per second ibm  per second dec pdp  per second cray supercomputer  per second personal computer defined size cost application small business home first one appeared january altair kit hobbyist bought radio shack trs apple computer hit market first preassembled microcomputer market growth remained sluggish two business student dan bricklin dan fylstra developed program run apple computer handle tedious recalculation school assignment program called visicalc forerunner spreadsheet program lotus visicalc useful tool apple sale took apple became standard program written apple today still see apple dominate school market ibm introduced pc unable run apple software unlike apple ibm product ibm pc open architecture mean technical detail operated published right along product introduction permitted hundred company write software program ibm pc well variety accessory adding ibm sterling reputation open architecture enable rapid market penetration microcomputer longer toy business tool open architecture however also allowed generation
