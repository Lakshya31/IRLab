beat human playing  armadon    armadon rushing uppercutspinning death probably useful move go projectile attack hit opponent recovers add end combo extra damage knock spinning death faster ca nt hit projectile due recovery time leaf vulnerable longer blocked rushing uppercut nt leave vulnerable blocked easier people get disadvantage lasting long  result getting hit back head whatever projectile tried go choose one learn well hornication uppercut nt great standing horn button  even jumping horn enough hit someone air also faster pull  tailtrip tack spinning death youre quick enough main strong point ability easily bounce opponent air horn jumping strong horn button hit tap button  right away pull quick hit combo air blizzard     nt sit cold breath get killed want fun use punching bag lot also opponent nothing move keep hitting button  keep punching get tired opponent wiggle joystick max damage   hit yes hit combo get nothing special  lightning bolt another note punching bag  sure look cool nt damage right wrong finish higharcing uppercut button jump forward normal jump power jump aerial attack followed air throw hurt  another good tactic ice geyser whenever trip opponent trip  fast enough catch falling hit air throw also standing single double uppercut respectively hitting jumping opponent air usually ice geyser better take longer pull chaos   nt really know  nt care much one ive talked much experience playing nasty trick computer fart fury either flying butt slam ground shaker forcing move way resulting damage stunned fart cloud blizzard double uppercut standing normal uppercut whenever trip opponent batterin ram hit land lucky double uppercut hit little bit extra damage diablo    nt played enough know much lunging bite upwards much like talon  tail trip usually hit rushing uppercut trip fast enough fighting guy keep throwing projectile time pulverizer aka velcro try blizzard see stomp learn stop people require  ummm training others prepared called cheezer sauron    pretty slow  trouble getting move involve moving joystick except combo primal scream force shield good never use opponent nt jumping case nt noticed nt extend way ground leaf vulnerable rushing low attack stun roar pretty useless earthquake stomp good inexperienced player get lucky whenever trip opponent try get cranium crusher  like blizzard usually hit hit ground sizeable amount damage primal scream work great jumping opponent take brain welltimed fierce bite  course ca nt forget cranium crusher ability wipe jumping opponent talon cheeze god   easiest player master annoying new pick pounce flip move need know whenever hit someone ground add move real quick extra hit short slide  long slide opponent corner fast pounce flip hit land pounce flip go sauron stun roar blizzard cold breath vertigo venom hit recover new player play either use pounce flip use frantic fury case former block right back unable block take full damage usually stop round two case repeatedfranticfuryinthecornercheeze slide trapped corner try quick jab button standing quick bite upwards slower powerful lunging bite upwards great taking jumping opponent annoying trick talon someone jump hold jab button usually jumping move miss hit couple time jab followed pounce flip unblockable hit combo course label cheezer get beat rougher arcade warned vertigo    tail best weapon even blocked enormous damage opponent brain guage jumping always jump button low tail swipe hit opponent ease mean possible exception armadon opponent jump late hit tail hit tap  quickly hit tail combo upper attack meaning way hit opponent air easily although jump backwards hit  might hit voodoo spell might land front dizzied land behind trip                                     general strategy computer fighting style                                    armadon    armadon quite deadly especially higher difficulty level jumping good idea many air defense real way fight play defensively walk backwards probably spinning death iron maiden spinning death block bite back wait iron maiden jump hit air close try rushing uppercut block hit really close try trip follow unblockable spinning death large chunk health blizzard     blizzard really dangerous freeze get close nt jump unless cold breath likely get caught ice geyser wait ground either cold breath long mega punch blocked countered may walk first yet see walk trip jump always power jump wait last second attack blizzard freeze ice geyser youre high hit computer never power jump close range attacking jumping finish move soon unfreeze mean try jumping attack get frozen high enough still stand good chance unfreezing hitting blizzard anyway chaos   guy plain deadly higher level jump probably hit batterng ram get knocked bock low jump right away  start combo even stand one favorite trick fart fury backing block ground shaker sending cloud stand simply walk trip followed battering ram case time really vulnerable farting puking also wait last possible second attack jump usually wo nt battering ram time hit diablo    exactly hard diablo get little tough high level time mega lunge perfectly hit whenever jump best time get spit fireball head nice big target also try jumping attacking last possible second usually delay mega lunge long enough either hit first land behind lunge away leaf vulnerable tailtrip move need far enough away would land behind work sauron    sauron pretty simple unless get unlucky nt know play character jump probably get hit primal scream force shield knock take half brain time panic sauron jump  hit combo learn recognize instant started really one  jumping tail low bite low tail cranium crusher uppercut unless full brain gauge youll dizzy  usually  dead best time get stun roar like diablo make stun roar take step two forward walk backwards time obediant  stupid  talon   guy death large pointy claw stay ground  combo human could ever hope pull best idea stay far away ground better yet keep jumping attacking instant leave ground done properly talon jump head bashed whatever extremity chose extend seems jump knock take step backwards power jump vertigo    actually pretty weak unless get close combo blindingly fast nt massive amount damage habit almost always spitting venom twice row rarely even hit first one stay ground though  jump wo nt jumping way go although must hit button get attack  jump try  bite combo pretty much beat way talon                                      specific strategy                                     charging guide least refers holding button move either standing still walking usually backwards say want armadon spinning death button  back halfcircle back hold button press back joystick charging  need flick joystick fireball motion backwards complete move however push back joystick first press button charging move walking backwards refer direction bracket  ex charging back make move much easier time still blocking move starting back direction anyway following list way beat computer player using character almost always work better general strategy lot unknown point  try using general strategy best armadon v       armadon pretty simple get timing right keep screen length apart rushing uppercut usually computer armadon try hornication uppercut result sticking horn butt back screen length away stand rushing uppercut done right also knock armadon spinning death rushing uppercut happen time wrong block two thing try hit horn case back start otherwise try hit tail twice unless really close first swing miss rushing uppercut quickly knock upside head spiked tail also play defensively charge back spinning death armadon get far away spinning death block return favor nt stay close tailtripspinning death  blizzard pretty easy similar talon get screen length away charging back either rushing uppercut spinning death wait long mega punch cold breath soon either rushing uppercut spinning death latter better leaf vulnerable blizzard block time repeat good finish faster jumping combo soon cold breath  chaos wait last possible second round start spinning death usually hit battering ram love start get chance move  diablo unknown wait fireball pound head  sauron make sauron stun roar rushing uppercut spinning death take step forward walk backwards charging back rushing uppercut spinning death usually make soon stand repeat needed  talon annoying time usually nt difficult basic idea hit strong horn button air horn hit immediately hit  quick hit air combo jump hit button instant leave ground work best standing right next take least blocking damage nt jump find hitting air try button instead wide tail swing longer range nt jump around random though knock jump instant stand back second earlier time right jumping instead hit immediately push button quick hit combo air  vertigo easy idea fighting talon get right next either jumping  combo jumping  blizzard v        armadon principle fighting armadon v armadon must get close asap usually starting long mega punch work instant finish punch start hitting button early ducking jab button jab miss pushed back usually nd rd immediately another long mega punch start jabbing actually work well although occasionally hit horn block punch  blizzard get far back mega punch range keep cold breath usually respond one cancelling air eventually though try mega punch frozen wo nt hit unless close look like ground still possible hit nice jumping combo another trick power jump  attack actually attacking directly way hit ice geyser position jump miss unfreeze land behind sometimes hitting way real trick learning anticipate cold breath jump  remember little trick ice geyser recovers fast wo nt able freeze hit  chaos stay far away cold breath hell usually puke something instead blocking time jump puke combo remember ca nt freeze combo ie freeze trip ice geyser  autocheeze let chaos combostun early back far freeze soon get back  diablo unknown bash head fireball  sauron cold breath usually cause sauron try leaping bone bash  hopefully frozen way sauron cooperating throwing lot stun roar stya close sweep whenever duck stun roar trip time  talon annoying little sucker talon playing armadon want get close jump attacking soon leave ground button  work best hit even nt follow air throw usually taking step forward jumping air throw seems work pretty good talon usually try slide projectile throw follow pounce flip time right possible cold breath right get back catching try slide walk punching bag high arcing uppercut normal jumping aerial attack followed air throw freeze repeat work well long never miss cold breath  nt way beat unless really good really bored look good fun  vertigo talon jump button seem work best nt forget air throw chaos v      armadon back far even corner armadon almost always spinning death instant block battering ram hit recovers side back repeat  blizzard unknown  chaos unknown  diablo opposite fighting armadon keep battering ram diablo fast block first one try bite get hit second one instead wait stand  sauron unknown  talon unknown  vertigo unknown diablo v       armadon one work great first inferno flash teleport nt appear close armadon jump away teleport appear right next soon  low low low  hot foot low bite low bite trip hot foot unless really slow wo nt able block wait stand work player though well ca nt get hot foot fast enough leave cheeze still work without take longer  blizzard little tricky work pretty well stand screen length away wait cold breath immediately pulverizer fast enough hit blizzard recovers cold breath see call pulverizer velcro walk backwards  usually try cold breath long mega punch might able get mega lunge recovers  chaos exact armadon teleport close low bite trip hot foot work great  diablo try pulverizer spit fireball hard time effective hit  sauron totally effective definately make look really cheezy  keep teleporting inferno flash really really fast usually sauron block fast enough toast try attack work best corner also side effect wearing wrist joystick use risk also autocheeze hit time row also try pulverizer stun roar see general computer pattern make stun roar  talon pretty much jump whack tail  screen away knock throw fast fireball try slide get hit instead close though expect trip pounce flip combo  vertigo unknown sauron v      quick note sauron air throw work long opponent gound touching part body mean get nasty air combo followed air throw sauron big ground touching least foot enough throw  armadon back kind rushing move rushing uppercut spinning death etc fierce bite  close corner power jump get  sauron big never make armadon bedonails also screen length apart fierce bite  keep walking backwards try horn bite face first close hit  blizzard really fast leaping bone bash try freeze cold breath otherwise trying hit jumping combo work pretty good  chaos desperate get back far stun roar usually power puke block puke hit stun roar make dizzy quickly probably difficulty killing time strategy stun roar little damage  diablo jump nt attack last moment usually make mega lunge miss youll land behind  tailtrip low  followed cranium crusher hit ground  sauron unknown  talon like blizzard jump button air throw hit  vertigo like playing blizzard jump button work fine air throw hit talon v      armadon suprisingly one easier people beat talon simply block inital attack round quick jab button block hit jab take step forward repeat quick enough hard hit hit even hit spinning death way really want impress large crowd watching awe try combo  little difficult pull consistently though sure start pushing jab button button finish double slash count small combo instead using rule ie block jab step forward assuming hit first jab jab jab jab double slash jab jab pounce flip hit damage lightning bolt kazoo  blizzard quite easy stand beginning blizzard cold breath long mega punch pounce flip land charge standing pounce flip repeat always snapping jaw cheeze see section  chaos time right get pounce flip puking puke actually get animated best way found knock way wait instant see head dust getting double slash nt matter immediately pounce flip double slash effect helping time p f perfectly hit chaos start puke also corner pounce flip usually draw fart fury chaos instead usual battering ram  diablo usually much like fighting talon get close jab button push back jump  jump hit nt jump probably mega lunge miss nt push button long slide low  catch behind finish mega lunge repeat  sauron wait stun roar pounce flip land walk sauron touch immediately walk backwards usually cause sauron stun roar know  talon everyone else keep jumping usually claw rake work jumping although talon hit lot switch button hit push joystick hit button snapping jaw extra hit jump find computer talon nt jab button jump push away keep comboing land  vertigo beat crap outta jumpkicks veryone else get close jump button  always snapping jaw cheeze see section vertigo v       armadon back long stay tailsweep range ok spinning death rushing uppercut block fierce bite  scorpion sting jump fierce bite hit land ground back corner go defensive crouch backdown wait hit hold back tailsweep knock near corner teleport repeat also possible difficult block spinning death trip low  scorpion sting combo  blizzard unknown except snapping jaw cheeze see section  chaos time right lucky jump last possible second hit button particular tail move low probably hit head try battering ram  diablo unknown  sauron unknown  talon like everyone else jump preferably close hit button soon leave gound hit quickly hit button  extra hit button bounce  vertigo like fighting talon                                    cool stuff                                    section various cheezes bug interesting stuff nt fit anywhere else forgot mention  snapping jaw cheeze  interesting ai glitch seems work talon vertigo verified vertigo blizzard diablo seems like possible use chaos armadon might fall also talon centered joystick button vertigo centered joystick button basically getting far enough away magic bite nt quite hit keep tapping appropriate button done right get head bashed done right happens first hit miss computer stare start second bite computer try hit bite fast though hit computer instead next hit miss miss bite miss bite etc short  keep tapping button keep getting hit brainfried warned though  talon vertigo really pissed  killed combo fast ca nt even tell woke  armadon shredder bug  work talon seen work computer armadon stage win armadon way corner usually case use armadon cheeze listed talon section shredder fatality happen talon spin around drift armadon spin spin like  second blood drift edge screen whole time armadon stare sky swaying back forth like drunk still count fatality though  slipnslide bug  computer part code built push two character apart touch figure nt overlap making appear solid among thing however bug code sometimes result one character sliding way across screen reach edge sometimes taking character happens quite frequently armadon rushing uppercut blocked  hit slide way across screen good playing talon happened  slid right  opponent right pushed way corner sat trying back hitting jab button could block finally told screwed attack stopped anything let joystick center got good good  rising body bug  seen bug personally probably related slipnslide bug seems one character match diablo lying lifeless ground suddenly body rose flew screen degree angle  final battle bug  one nice somehow manage glitch game get character blizzard completely block move throw die since move damage final round work someone quite fast even move blocked note however kind grabbing move talon face ripper chaos grabnthrow etc cancel bug make computer fight  vertigo bite crap outta forever bug  might work others seen vertigo v computer armadon way game work give time finish combo even opponent health run dont mess fatality well seems vertigo bite sooo quick keep theorectically forever guy playing nt know pushing button finished armadon low jab nt realize killed kept hitting armadon good  time realized stopped armadon promptly fell nt move  autocheeze  autocheeze combination move always brings game cheeze sign basically combo involves freezingdizzying opponent twice example voodoo spell dizzy opponent bite come slither set resulting opponent released combostun tm cold breath blizzard followed tripice geyser combo set well repeated unblocked inferno flash diablo effect jumpkickface ripper talon remember sign cheeze unless guy playing bigger                                     get newest version primal rage faq primal
