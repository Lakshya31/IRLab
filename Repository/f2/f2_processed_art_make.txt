inhaling portable bong oz chamber small stoner feel smoke entering hisher lung second lighting personally indifferent largesmall chamber since fairly athletic healthy lung capacity take big hit bong  biggest make gag cough though gungho used big chamber nice though use multiple breath burn lot bud filling large chamber chamber filled carb suck mindnumbing amount smoke threefoot bong cool watch  packet  smoke travel bong carbed deciding drill carb necessary understand volume container must split water chamber space usually drill halfway higher maximum water volume remember though water level higher  bud line  else bowl bud get soaked water travelling stem would also caution leaving little chamber space smoke seems harsher inhaled straight water easier stomach smoke inhaled rather gradually smoking extinguishing bowl                 hung many bongsmokers meager  year smoking seen many way smoking bong simplest way course cover carb light wait till lung full carb inhale chamber variation basic technique mentioned one good thing smoking bowl extinguish bowl order prevent wasting bud best technique seen partialy cover bowl lighter second carb method taper air flow toward end completely stop burning bowl completely covered bong carbed longer bong might want use several breath covered carb fill long chamber smoke carbing pull full chamber worth smoke stoner friend mine tends take smaller hit single breath nt violate stoner etiquette see nt know way effective one long draw reasoning tell carbing multiple time single breath would cause waste lung powerspace figure breath go faster open carb le air resistance le lung time used uncovered carb better however nt tried way ca nt accurately critique method etiquette     disclaimer section etiquette meant personal observation stoner manner mean imply stoner whole conduct smoking bong etiquette seems allow person one lungful inhalation per turn rude start breath even due bad lighting technique wasted lung space exception delay caused faulty lighter turntaker also allowed finish chamber smoke carbed second breath person nt get good amount smoke hit allowed smoke first going order new bowl bong lighter smoothly passed onto next stoner veteran stoner already extinguished bowl bud wasted next person etiquette host suggests provide hisher guest spittoon garbage water munchies optional generous needle say ambience comfortable inviting bud best enjoyed company entertainment bud shared friend bowl packer subject much looser constraint since person packing bowl essence everyone else favor argument made recipient bowl packer dictator direct route bong also smoke much bud want even turn whatever kindest bowl packer pack much bud large bowl air barely sucked pas bong around order repack bowl liberally everyone money afford philosophy stoner usually generous people usually person packing bowl take first hit new bowl always fresh bowl passed someone else generous gesture towards stoner stoner obnoxious often labeled  bad stoner  unfarly derisive term mean stoner act goofy stoned uncool blame stoner goofy behavior fact stoned easy make stoner self conscious suck polite allow everyone enjoy bud way judgmental others best attitude relax enjoy company surroundings bud finicky way  every experienced stoner know good mood stoning lighter     lighter come variety shape size ordinary cigarette lighter adequate smoking bud best ordinary lighter used best make sure flame least   tall lighting lighter best held vertically flame sucked edge bowl onto bud method avoids singed finger
