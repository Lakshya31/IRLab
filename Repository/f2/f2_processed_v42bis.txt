word one manufacturer modem would connect another manufacturer modem standard exist allow interconnection different manufacturer modem modulation standard mid international consultative committee telephone telegraph ccitt french established v standard v standard describes modem  talk  using twoway signaling   bps dialup telephone line unfortunately v standard provide method error control since

describes two error correction scheme primary protocol link access procedure modem lapm secondary protocol functionally equivalent mnp class lapm method offer slightly better error recovery reliability mnp class v mnp class protocol help maintain reliability little improve throughput protocol convert asynchronous data character synchronous data stream making bit oriented protocol instead character oriented asynchronous character consist one start bit eight data bit one stop bit total ten bit per character v remove start stop  framing  bit result increase efficiency however order protocol work v add overhead back transmission resulting cushion help maintain full transfer speed period moderate error correction activity usually caused noisy telephone line practical purpose result v link error free transmission using bit redundancy check detect every error bit smaller probability result chance error occurring small practice ignore data compression standard next step increasing throughput involves data compression data compression used provide modem effective data throughput rate higher modem bps transmission speed amount increase throughput depend largely type data transferred microcom introduced mnp class data compression protocol software supporting mnp class protocol offer ability compress file half original size transmission thus providing increase speed however  increase speed typical mnp class requires concurrent error correction using mnp class late ccitt issued vbis standard describing implement data compression hardware vbis us lempelziv compression algorithm offer greater data compression mnp class bps modem mean potential throughput  bps file transfer however throughput  bps non compressed file expected vbis standard adapts data flow quickly mnp class turning data compression required give advantage mnp class transmitting previously compressed file since mnp class compression algorithm cause compressed file expand reducing throughput vbis simply pass precompressed data without trying compress vbis compression software work hardware us v error correction protocol data transfer using file transfer protocol send receive
