hard disk management level batch file      user created file extension bat file contains line do command think file  macro  created ascii text editor including built edlin editor see created  console  keyboard via copy con useful program startup use type command view content batch file c type bat c cdlotus cd cl use print command print content batch file c print autoexecbat print command like type command except external do command send output printer instead screen another approach using redirection discussed earlier would c type autoexecbat prn autoexecbat       user created optional batch file sought do system booted file boot disk do automatically open execute outstanding way automate execution certain do command like date time path prompt etc done every time system booted ex date time path c c do c batch c utility subst e c dbasedbfiles prompt p g cl configsys      ascii file created viewed like autoexecbat also optional sought do system booted however command line file us do type command found bat file rather special configuration system command configuration system command needed define certain hardware parameter example system us special size disk drive extra printer extra modem extra input device joystick mouse ram disk etc ex configsys file buffer example file mean do allow file opened simultaneously line present configsys do would allow file need certain program dbase accounting etc state early manual parameter need set software operate correctly buffer defines staging area within ram portion file screen yet example accounting program told computer bring last invoice entered would display invoice however unknown actually took last invoice anticipation would want see right away also extra system brought ram sitting within buffer do allows way speed system item sitting ram accessed seemingly instantly versus item must sought disk told do automatically set buffer buffer useful set maximum reason do guessing information need next guess wrong example next invoice wish look ago must first check buffer realizing go disk retrieve needed information actually slows process case purchased software note command needed set buffer common level operate edlin   edlin line editor supplied do disk basic word processor allows creation editing batch file including autoexecbat configsys file file like document computer read interprets line file contains single thought computer edlin device create document enter edlin environment type word edlin followed name file wish create edit c edlin configsys asterisk appear type letter press enter go insert mode computer responds refers line configsys creating type line press enter finished press f key return furthest left asterisk file buffer f asterisk type e press enter end process save created e c edlin command left asterisk l would list screen entire content file edited would delete line file would allow inserting new command beginning line  would allow making change line edlin adequate creating editing small batch type file saw earlier another technique creating file utilizing copy con command even limited edlin backup restore          periodically entire hard drive least subdirectory containing data file backedup onto floppy tape safe storage event hard drive crash accidental erasure happen file simply restored do provides two command accomplish backup restore command unfortunately slow problematic world full third party alternative far superior speed ease use data compression ability incorporate batch file operator need  kickoff  batch file supply floppy nearby complete ex using do command c backup c lotuswks   destination drive c lotus source directory wks specifies file extension wks worksheet file specifies subdirectory beneath lotus directory contain wks file file modified since last backup using disk set last used backup note supply disk   drive ready floppy formatted required sure number sequence process erase whatever used disk file need restored hard drive due failure erasure start  disk    drive restore c lotuswks   source file modified deleted since backed command designed emergency situation better nothing many wish use way transfer large group file one machine another work version do machine identical another problem end large number disk data compression competing product provide result fewer backup disk final hazard end disk disk number lost destroyed may never able access disk   disk set like one continuous floppy disk destroying disk like destroyed giant continuous floppy true competing product like fastback pctools norton utility xcopy   beginning do  xcopy command useful hybrid copy command backuprestore mess address issue copy copy file disk hold xcopy copy single file larger single disk like backup command c xcopy c  mmddyy option includes subdirectory hung current one case shown root directory includes file modified since last xcopy performed mmddyy include file date greater equal one specified xcopy faster copy backup command able transfer entire directory like backup copy file selectively modification status date able use copy command do version independent copy individual file later date unlike backup unable copy single file larger single disk backup able remember continuous disk concept target disk must formatted hard disk organization principal                 put directory root directory except commandcom configsys autoexecbat use many batch file put batch subdirectory keep path command short autoexecbat path c do c batch c utility keep directory sorted use third party software tool defragment file regular basis use third party software pctools norton utility vopt etc  end file press esc return main menu
