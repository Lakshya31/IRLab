file transfer protocol unlike older protocol like zmodem separate low level multiplexed transfer layer mslp high level file transfer layer new design simplifies protocol design give maximum efficiency high  multiplexing made possible send one file one continuous stream without break file boost multiple file transfer dramatically multiplexing also made possible add full screen ansibbs terminal emulator local full featured line editor colored back scroll buffer unlimited size smodem locally buffered terminal emulation allows chat full speed bidirectional file transfer protocol symmetrical nature connect smodem looping transmitted character back receiver reason limit transfer one direction smodem transfer file direction time without noticeable performance loss smodem detects desqview dpmi window o free unused processor capacity host system smodem totally written c language compiled microsoft visual c v compiler using full optimization cpu need kb free memory function properly want shell smodem magical multitasking continue file transfer drop do multiplexed serial link protocol mslp                    mslp capability manage independent channel simultaneously every single channel us traditional two phase acknak type subprotocol maximum efficiency achieved using multiple parallel channel simultaneously keep transmitter busy maximum packet size float byte transfer error reduce packet size depending error frequency one important detail mslp need resend failed packet transmitter window size total size transmitted packet acknowledged limited get faster response packet frame contains one byte channel number two byte bit ccitt itu crc algorithm used error correcting modem acknowledgement enquiry included packet frame needed packet separator contain two byte two byte found transferred data one byte inserted capsulation possibility find separator byte random data small affect protocol efficiency like old style one byte separator maximum efficiency onedirection error free transfer max packetsize                    max packetsize frame size packet size limited byte efficiency  still better original zmodem data link transfer special character traditional character encapsulation mode could activated mode encapsulates selected character code inflicts performance  additional  every selected code data link limited data bit special bit collection mode could activated highest bit every seven byte collected one byte collection inflicts performance  double character encapsulation possibility maximum transfer line correction mode mslp us five character transmit four character using printable bit ascii code mode work almost every non transparent transmission line maximum correction mode inflicts performance used test purpose default setting work
