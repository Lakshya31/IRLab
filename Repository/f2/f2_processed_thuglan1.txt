introduction hacking lan official thug production written laughing gas solsbury hill bb please keep filename thuglantxt possible foreward nt lot experience hacking alot different type lan secret information could nt found one else little hard work effort spare hard work wrote file going make one file include everything since already k without specific discussion novell system going break series keep look next file information actual hacking novell system possibly file focusing system subject discussed content basically foreward lan basic basic novell network logging do system file brute force hacking onward  lan basic people know nothing computer telecommunication network file probably wo nt useful attempt provide information way least experienced computer user understand end brief section exact lan work soon lan stand local area network network computer term system allows person one computer share resource one computer two main type lan wan wide area network wan conforms definition network way lan allows person one computer use resource one computer difference lan small network usually contained single building single complex wan almost never contained single building complex usually extends several state across entire nation internationally example wan internet one biggest hacked wan ever internet connected world thousand upon thousand computer university military site commerical site another type network psn similar wan always extend complex psn stand packet switching network psn bundle packet data local terminal assemble local pad packet assemblerdisaseembler send series inbetween pad reach destination disassembled pad fed computer allows psn pad chain pad local pad b pad b local pad c pad local pad c send packet b c pay expense sending directly c psn almost always us phone line least part connection wan lan operates different principal sends information directly local terminal destination case wan information may pas phone line might depending exactly internet connected university log computer university direct connection call another university military site data travel phone line maybe even psn another network lan always local direct connection common set lan terminal one room hooked one server case assume true example throughout file unless otherwise specified also assume lan set ibm mspcdos compatible computer one scenario lan set would like ibm p model dual k drive k memory hard drive hooked ibm p model w meg memory meg hard drive  meg  meg drive case model would server terminal would boot disk network alternate situation would computer boot prom redirect local drive activity allow terminal boot server hard drive put do disk terminal turned could use full k memory drive whatever wanted however put network boot disk ran network setup login program disk would connected logged network point could access program server hard drive basically giving nonhard drive machine meg drive share need one copy program run matter many people using assuming course program network compatible program perhaps bb program something using communication interrupt file constantly open etc may function network crash terminal whole network however special program installed network allow different terminal share file data file saved server hard drive local disk drive one function network software capture do interrupt int mspcdos decide either pas do handle basic novell network logging novell netware tm one common piece network software availible ibm mspcdos network basically novell work like either boot disk computer boot prom hard drive autoexecbat find setup somewhat like comment preceded semicolon echo prompt p g change prompt include path mouse load mouse driver stuff beginning ipx option prepares computer network net load network login automatically log computer menu net load nifty menu computer thing may mouse driver may extra thing initialize plotter etc etc anyway ipx net probably login xxx way login program work thus running login option get prompt  username  entering valid username  password  prompt may different nt enter valid username let know enter login one option try process username valid recieve  password  prompt enter two parameter process first username second password isnt login xxx type command login command prompt username password network prompt username password youre stuck hacking get file mainly cover see section later getting line  menu net  execute network menu function menu defined net school network selection word perfect typing tutor etc another command run program command simply do menu net menu whatever command simply hit escape esc key answer yes press return do believe possible set network automatically log point never seen happens still do type login log enter name password type  type autoexecbat  see login command enter logged network do automatically put sort program boot find get do format menu discussed detail next file basically name menu first line menu option seperate line command run menu option following least one space like  cut  main menu menu name word perfect menu option cdwp change wp dir wp run word perfect cdlogin change back login dir foxbase menu option cdfox fox cdlogin  cut  etcetera etcetera do find drive availible nonibm people type followed return b followed return c return etc way z ever get  ready error reading drive whatever abort retry ignore  hit abort ca nt hurt anything write letter successful ae likely terminal drive terminal diskless terminal ae probably wo nt exist b exist floppy ce local hard drive although probably possible configure ae network drive system adminsitrator lan set one school lan set terminal floppy k b terminal floppy k ce configured local drive none installed f main network drive vz specific network program nt real drive rather  fake  drive created subst do program file directory f autoexecbat byte phoney autoexec since bootdisks req guide bat load teacher guide something directory public contains public info net program directory system contains network utility directory mail subdirectory contain mail directory login dups file logging data directory dbase dbase iii directory wp contains word perfect  directory vp vplanner directory typing typing tutor directory alpha alphabetic keyboarding directory fox foxbase directory various program drive vz like v vp f vp directory subst v w wp w wp directory subst w etc z subst mean  substituted  do program called substexe allows make directory one drive complete new virtual drive interesting program f public system mail boring nt information mail directory like set like f mail f mailz f mail f maild etc although assume would easy enough read mail type command program reading text file system directory file interesting actual program also exist public data file generally boring although might want scan see anything interesting system file one main section cut file sequel file complete list file distributed network well do file nondos familiar user complete description use advantage meantime nonmsdos user quick rundown file handled type dir get directory listing show file directory current subdirectory filename msdos consists character plus character extension ie autoexecbat filenameext ff file extension com exe executed typing name file optionally extension do prompt like c public file extension bat script shell file straight ascii form executed also typing name do prompt executed line line do command interpreter instead actually loaded program data code segment do batch language pretty shitty far script language go used dealing unix advanced language hate file dir instead file size sub directory make current directory typing  cd directoryname  ie  cd lan  go two sub directory typing  cd lanlan  go one subdirectory typing  cd   cdspaceperiodperiod top typing  cd  another note autoexecbat file automatically executed time computer booted disk resides good place add command configsys file load driver memory going cover do file command may next file completely dosuneducated suggest ask friend buy book sure also do tutorial availible text form enough commodore apple type people ask ill write comprhensive file explaining do command basically thing hacker dossystem might want know remember call messydos brute force hacking system get straight loginexe w option autoexec login w name need know password never encountered actually brute force hacking social engineering two common account know supervisor system admin guest probably left school system account  computer one lab another c c cc system secure enough force accountpassword known login doubt break autoexec worth try bang away ctrlc ctrlbreak much optionally boot disk make  w autoexec login however like get someone already system install trojan snag password etc actually finding password several program availible various type lan various type computer source sometimes intercept call log keystroke login program store result hidden file unsecure lan program almost defintely going yield success rate probably wont found installed right lan unsecure one school could stick pirate ware right public directory one would notice least nt yet conclusion well wrap next file include novell specific info complete information novell file also corrected lot misinformation miswording file likely missed include correction next file find anything wrong contact solsbury hill laughing gas
