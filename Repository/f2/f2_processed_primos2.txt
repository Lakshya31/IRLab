line prime use standard  ok  prompt series shall assume prime us  ok  prompt type nonsensical command try arf happen ok arf found arf std cp er notice enter invalid command get new prompt standard system  er  prompt changed series shall assume set  er  note std cp mean standard command processor sometimes instead std cp get processcommand error thing differ ent name different revision level going want perform action make sure safe first action turn como file como abbreviated form comoutput command comoutput turn buffer much like terminal program copy buffer time como file turned everything type everything primo say logged sam sequential access method file text file turn como file type system prompt ok como e  e  argument mean  end  end como process cant see typing perhaps initiating como command turned terminal output turn back typing ok como tty save time nest argument ok como e tty next thing make sure person using account logged nt want irate user hand typing ok stat assuming logged user prime primo output following line user oct dec device prime user  user  column display user id   column list user number  line  column indicates amlc line using physical

terminal perform rudimentary task running prin ters backing system running rje batch job manager etc perform many activity almost always geared towards system need dsm user distributed system management utility runnung phantom dsm utility present help system admin administrate system dsm utility part iii series help prepared two table cover procedure first time use table memorized pretty good login procedure como e stat logged yes logout stat u lot user online yes logout logout procedure rsterm lo section go basic primo comm ands familiarize memorize  basic primo command information primo file ready start covering first primo command add new repetoire section learn move around primo directory structure view file get full status prime system get help first let tell little bit directory set logical disk prime root directory called mfd main file directory mfd system unique number manner logical disk mfd separate one another mfd directory called ufd user file directory ufds user login ufd however login directory dir ectories ufd level called subufd subdirectory illus tration talking follows mfd       mfd       mfd       mfd     ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd sub sub sub sub sub ufd ufd ufd ufd ufd notice ufd subufd illustrated fact subufd subufd set lot like micro computer disk operating system login attached account initial attach point ie  home  directory likely ufd case attach mfd case move directory directory youll use attach command abbreviate attach primo underst ands attach command basic format attach attach pathname attach mfd would type ok mfd logical device number mfd wish attach mfd nu mbers always start increment sequentially attached mfd ufd simply need use ufd name wish attach pathname wish attach subufd need use full pathname example ok mfd ok primenet ok info toplevel directory found inaccessible info attach ok primenet info notice tried attach info got error well info subufd need supply full pathname tach subufd notice attached info correct manner used   character separate element pathname locating available mfd logical device number easy type ok stat disk primo return output disk ldev pdev system comdev user

immediately data  disk   ldev  col umns disk partition mfd system find two useful utility ex ternal command simplify moving directory primo use n allows move specified number level specification  n  optional specify value default value directoryname allows move one directory tree must specify name directory wish move need specify ufd subufd name need specify entire pathname utility prime upload prime cmdnc directory external command stored information part v viewing file primo easy simply use slist seq uential list command format follows slist filename must include file extension file slisting briefly list file type mean extension slistable description abbrev n abbreviation file ba basic source code bin n binary image file cbl cobol source code cc c compiler source code comi

id access ufd currently attached assume attached initial login ufd also assume user id stevesys example listaccess would display ok listaccess acl protecting  current directory  stevesys system rest none command example display acl access control list regarding ufd notice stevesys right ufd naturally also notice system right likely backup purpose also notice rest meaning user id right let assume attached another user ufd say john might get ok john ok listaccess acl protecting  current directory  john system simson dalurw rest lur quite different story john system right wait simson dalurw access rest everyone else lur cryptic phrase mean would gather would good time explain primo access code without ado code right applies allows user                             p protect directory change access attribute delete directory delete directory entry add directory add directory entry l list directory list directory entry u use directory attach directory r read file read file content w write file change file content illustrated none mnemonic also primo access code indicates yes full well guess none indicated access denied also aware file system group file protected access category list access access category type following command listaccess categoryfilename next listgroup command list acl group belong group may govern access file system nt belong group primo reply group listgroup otherwise primo respond following format group help administrator etcetera listgroup command abbreviated lg listpriorityaccess abbreviation lpac used display priority access given disk partition normally would use listaccess examine access right priority acl file system object lpac available since priority acl prevent accessing directory using listaccess command command format follows listpriorityaccess pathname brief listquota command abbreviated lq opinion pseudoworthless since file quota information displayed ld list directory comm issued lq command display current disk quota storage info rmation current specified directory issue command need l list access target directory u use access higher directory proper command format listquota pathname brief executed without pathname listquota return information regarding current directory attached quota storage space constraint set directory limit listed disk record quota great indicates quota quota absolutely lousy quota  ok directory quota say total number disk record used directory sub ufd may exceed quota p protect access current ufd use setquota command change ufd quota constraint know getting subject hand

communication always useful know send receive message computer system primo exception whether communicating hacker online attempting social engineer legitimate user system operator user prime may send receive message message may sent user terminal user terminal user terminal system console system console user terminal system console specific user terminal system console system console another node network primenetequipped system sending message user prime easy message command form follows message username nodename usernumber abbreviation message instead typing message time type instead notice username usernumber sending message user need specify one send message user system would type ok system would enable send message user system aware message send displayed user logged user id system case user user id log ged time might want use usernumber argument work like ok  would send message user user number message send case would sent user user number use either user name user number using
