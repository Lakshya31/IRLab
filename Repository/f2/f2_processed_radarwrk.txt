traffic radar work first thing understand traffic radar almost nothing common military radar used civil defense aviation radar used airtraffic controller weather radar used meteorologist ten oclock news sophisticated radar measure speed object distance object radar station general shape object aid identification ground crew radar also cost hundred thousand dollar traffic radar hand ca nt larger fit dashboard midsize cruiser ca nt cost low bid municipality procurement process sometimes le traffic radar necessarily device limited capability constricted view first limitation restricts amount territory traffic radar cover militaryaviationweather radar use rotating beam sweep full degree around antenna tower target within range displayed radar screen traffic radar us stationary beam much like searchlight shine road either forward backward way area surveillance traffic radar quite limited second limitation traffic radar concern amount information provide traffic radar nt radar screen single digital readout given time maximum amount information traffic radar provide one number significant limitation talk later looking trouble reasonable think traffic radar beam searchlight even though beam made microwave behaves much like light beam travel straight line easily reflected metallic object like car truck guard rail pass make effective reflector sending glint microwave around unpredictable direction like glint light unlike light however ca nt see beam microwave invisible human eye easily seen electronic eye case radio tuned microwave frequency fact radio connected compact antenna form basis traffic radar looking kid traffic radar work shining microwave searchlight road come range microwave beam bounce car radar antenna look reflection radar get speed microwave reflection used phenomenon physic known doppler principle heard doppler principle work sound wave classic example hear stand along railroad track train approach hear sound fixed pitch instant train pass begin move away hear lower pitch fact train making sound coming going stationary listener speed train add pitch sound approach subtracts departs change true pitch called doppler shift magnitude change depends upon speed train science go traffic radar applies doppler principle microwave microwave reflection approaching car shifted upward frequency departing car cause downward shift radar compare shifted frequency reflection original frequency beam sent difference calculated speed display digital readout thats really traffic radar cheap bulb dim bulb traffic radar purposely kept simple going back searchlight analogy know limit effectiveness flashlight spotlight powerful farther see applies radar since power cost money whether speaking searchlight radar traffic radar far le power expensive military radar traffic radar range limited accordingly fact microwave life strength beam diminishes distance radio wave general act way ed father travel le energy get example radar operator may able spray car microwave still mile away reflected signal travel mile back radar value weak get back radar electronics ca nt read unable compute speed range nearsighted electronic eye real life radar range depends upon two thing power radar reflectivity target already talked power built radar nothing reflectivity target definitely something aware however perhaps heard air force project called  stealth bomber  attempt build airplane poor radar reflectivity wo nt bounce back microwave beam bomber operating normal altitude would invisible enemy radar radar reflectivity mostly matter size shape least purpose describing highway vehicle smaller vehicle smaller reflection therefore shorter range car range radar drive within foot antenna hand big flat surface perpendicular beam make excellent reflector radar may blind small car foot away see semi mile half away right condition principle radar quite easily understood quirk operation behavior hard predict accuracy bottom line one thing absolutely sure however traffic radar monitor one target time one readout display one number get number several car truck beam surely would roadway even moderate traffic give one number fact serious traffic radar limitation made lowbid price must necessarily relatively simple device least low power traffic radar asset pretty well limit surveillance line sight simplest way narrowing field mandatory single number program electronics consider strongest reflection done traffic radar one simplification factor cause error one simplification introduces human element operator must look one number decide responsible human tough time keeping track invisible beam believing ca nt seen one vehicle range probably vehicle responsible number although could caused electrical interference blowing trash le obvious distraction microwave one vehicle range operator decide one producing strongest reflection closest one antenna largest one pack truth could either depending upon host subtlety skilled operator intent justice would nt write ticket unless absolutely sure le skilled operator might write ticket thinking right answer wrong careless operator intent filling quota might see number single likely perpetrator red sport car done deal human take chance plot thickens far discussion confined stationary radar kind waiting trap hill hidden behind bridge abutment complex system exists usually called  moving radar  allows operator check speed oncoming traffic patrol car motion priniciples involved stationary radar microwave beam look forward monitoring strongest reflection case oncoming terrain simultaneously beam monitor second strongest reflection take oncoming traffic internal calculator subtracts terrain speed patrol car speed closing speed patrol car oncoming traffic result displayed single number road speed target vehicle false witness frequently nt unquestionably military engineer could design moving radar would deliver accuracy every time traffic control budget one figured way eliminate mistake example moving radar frequently underestimate patrol car speed  cosine error  result speed target car substantially overestimated well know error state like wisconsin court take  judicial notice  moving radar say radar evidence alone considered persuasive point remember radar sophisticated electronic concept system proven effectiveness traffic radar limitation ca nt ignored best way defend good working knowledge limitation
