overwhelmed  traumatized ego function included managing person relation reality regulation drive object relation thought processing defensive function perception motor activity integration psychological function called synthetic function concept ego became center american psychoanalytic theory forty fifty sixty despite heroic rigorous effort sharpen term meaning confusion freud left ego subjective experience self continued persistent confusion merely result intellectual sloppiness bruno bettleheim proposes result freud english translator discomfort soullike implication freud original idea difficult fundamental terminologic theoretic confusion reflected clinical reality often happens people functioned badly area called  ego function  also major disturbance experience self two type difficulty exacerbated diminished concert idea ego unitary entity convenient confusing name set function described earlier sort waste basket neither id superego term reflect commonly observed covariation function systematic exploration self experience began psychoanalysis year following second world war though course concept self object study since dawn civilization although significant psychoanalytic precursor notably work paul federn erik erikson first propose core much psychopathology lie disorder self experience eriksons concept identity amalgamated many source belief one evocative common experience proved clinically useful many kind difficultly well normal supernormal psychological development usefully explored experience loss diffusion identity attempt establish satisfactory identity one lacking erikson work problematic psychoanalytic point view two reason first reading erikson carefully one discovers wonderful portrayal emotional state imagery metaphor clinical detail matched explicit clear theoretical formulation second writing often focus external environmental effect rather people psychological world manner construction erikson never systematically described therapeutic approach patient however clear consistently placed positive connotation patient struggle demonstrated manifest psychopathology could understood potentially successful attempt achieve valuable identity might difficulty way patient basic project way attempting accomplish closer healthy development patient society might recognize erikson psychobiographical study luther gandhi hitler shaw message reader many young value struggle form workable identity eriksons implicit view appreciative stance toward patient struggle include dominated external reality therapeutic year following second world war harry stack sullivan observed experience self many schizophrenic patient grossly disturbed borrowing chicago school sociology notably george herbert mead sullivan conceptualized self summation social role retained without full awareness archaic period development  interpersonal theory  psychology pathology resulted self system internal incongruent problematic term environment therapeutic intervention consisted understanding appropriately revising self system light mature current understanding central discussion sullivan view self system product external environment made sense whatever outside social system several analyst notably klein winnicott khan fairburn bion spitz modell emphasized role holding environment environmental container  mother  development self different perspective emphasized self growth required external situation  held  emerging vulnerable self gained strength autonomy people whose psychopathology centered problematically self development condition author equated difficulty first two year life could work problem provided analytic situation allowed reengage phase analyst experienced archaic maternal environment era analyst believed like melaine klein early situation involved inherent conflict resolved interpretation analysis others like donald winnicott held new experience  beyond interpretation  goodenough object needed developmental failure could righted new development theoretical formulation many author either inherently fantastic abstruse unsystematic work relatively little influence psychoanalytic theory beyond range immediate follower integrated mainstream psychoanalytic thought margaret mahler coworkers also concerned early development self centered attention era late toddlerhood involved difficulty child emerging state called  symbiosis  experience self includes care taking environment state individual one right based treatment experience youngster adult seemed difficulty area self experience observation toddler unfortunately dominated preexisting theory mahler group concluded much difficulty self experience arose failure adequately separate mother infancy although many well informed analyst would disagree assert overwhelming data infant later developmental study demonstrate mahler symbiotic phase part normal development separateness sense meant characteristic ordinary healthy mature psychological function however clinical observation lead mahler thinking explained term theory certainly common many people seem shaky experience function conflicting notion one hand desperately need people function reasonably core aspect danger precisely urgently needed interaction starting sixty chicago heinz kohut initiated psychoanalytic study disorder self approach research methodologically distinct worth moment pause first took radical position claimed incorrectly time standard one psychoanalytic data collected manner different natural science asserted possible usually immediately comprehend complex psychological configuration others understanding ordinary mode operation working analyst empathy internal state mode comprehension kohut similar way perceive face complete immediate gestalt analytic training technique designed maximize analyst ability use investigative tool overcoming pitfall training microscopy enables u vastly extend ordinary visual capacity kohut claimed making explicit everyone anyway position right wrong deeply antithetical freud view psychoanalysis natural sciencelike investigation also hartman explicit statement empathy sense kohut meant appropriate role psychoanalytic investigation second le problematically position psychoanalytic investigative method kohut position transference early writing self psychology kohut assumed data taken seriously psychoanalysis data transference various story patient told analyst conceptual framework response stuff analyst commonly use frame picture patient psychology minimal importance compared job describing understanding interaction patient analyst kohut also believed premature interpretation effect patient avoiding knowing something often interfered full blossoming transference according kohut premature interpretation particularly premature interpretation defense often resulted analyst discovering evidence confirmed preexisting notion misunderstood possibly contrary clinical fact representative patient avoidance already known reality using empathy exploration transference primary tool kohut student treated group patient whose distress took three overlapping form one group patient suffered feeling depletion emptiness triviality andor fragmentation experience often took symbolic expression form hypochondriasis another set patient engaged activity seemed enormously driven addictive sexual promiscuity perversion shop lifting desperately clinging relation people substance abuse finally patient chronic acute state tantrum like rage analysis least conducted kohut follower patient developed characteristic attitude analyst kohut labeled selfobject transference characteristically often considerable internal resistance patient came experience analyst essential well physical psychological absence variously precipitated great distress andor reemergence symptom previously remitted example young man entered analysis much distressed promiscuous homosexual behavior reported major business success session analyst noting patient anxiety interfered even greater accomplishment made plausible interpretation patient inhibited even better experienced business competitor like analyst feared analyst reprisal patient beat competition interpretation bolstered several significant detail made plausible patient thought  right mark  promised  try better next time  retrospectively said felt irritable  headachy  immediately interpretation given evening returned gay pornographic movie theatre much sexual activity among patron analysis one regular haunt stopped patronizing theatre many month patient allowed several men perform fellatio felt angry painfully excited thought fallators really appreciated response felt analyst inadequately appreciative response patient desperately turned concrete indication someone could appreciate accomplishment another patient experienced every weekend  like sent away live sahara desert  return analysis  like coming back oasis  feeling interrupted patient like experience analyst characteristic way kohut described oversimplifying systemticity patient idealized analyst seeing embodiment strength good feeling alive whole presence others find relief sense unity analyst like appreciated interruption state mind commonly bring inordinate distress symptom could reasonably understood experience fragmented devitalized self attempt avoid experience clinical experience kohut posited group people maintenance satisfactory self experience centrally important problematic analysis patient characterized use analyst maintain cohesive vital self using image analyst part self support self interruption capacity use analyst manner lead reemergence problem area situation within analysis equated postulated normal developmental state caretaker ordinarily performs function self function kohut called selfobject function believed patient suffering disorder self resultant traumatic failure early selfobject function normal development small empathically supported failure selfobject function allow patient identify image way analyst functioned make function however mental health consist giving self object kohut asserted selfobject function normally continue across course life quality existence altered maturity made assertion kohut never elaborated demonstrated recently bertram cohler undertaken task exploring empirical evidence kohut position kohut finding finding many examined psychology self viewpoint questioned apparently distinct way whose interconnection show moment first objection kohut theory serve avoid painful psychological truth many phenomenon kohut observed observed previously classified defensive operation example idealization analyst commonly understood way avoid knowing unconscious demeaning analyst arrange disappointment analyst fails live idealization inevitably must idea patient  need  analyst function certain fashion lest core seriously damaged could understood fantasied misunderstanding designed rationalize wish whose nonfulfillment may extremely frustrating inherently must le psychologically fatally damaging second set objection theory self kohut never clearly defines central concept self essentially say everyone know experience self leaf studying many discussion meaning  self  psychoanalytic literature one reminded buddha comment self said believe self like  man say love beautiful woman land unable specify name family appearance  digha nikaya quoted carrithers essential theoretical difficulty clarified meissner pointed term self habitually used kohut writer whose work place self center psychological life consistently used refer psychological representation also psychological agent although systematic researcher example hartman limit concept self psychological representation person also give self markedly subsidiary role psychology meissner argument quite similar schafer later discussion internalization schafer observed elaborate analytic theory internalization fact nothing translation psychoanalytic jargon unconscious fantasy view represent represent actual psychological mechanism fact obscured actually happens experience described taking another person aspect person two problem self psychology use defense painful insight confusion agent image related notice self   psychological representation would follow patient idea dysfunctional direct result impairment representation seems mistaken least seemed many thoughtful psychoanalyst impairment mental agency could
