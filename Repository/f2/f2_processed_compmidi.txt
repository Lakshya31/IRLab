midi computerphile page midi primer computerphiles course pursuing dual interest music computer noticed one thing though  crossover  two field certainly evident hardware software computer folk seem know little weird musician type digital machine musician well many musician still think byte something go playing set hopefully report use computer people would like know something computer revolution swept music industry dont know start obviously large topic present broadest outline sufficient interest detailed report follow basic definition little history midi musical instrument digital interface communication protocol developed jointly american japanese manufacturer electronic musical instrument defined standard administered independent association international midi association least theoretically assures compatibility among equipment produced different manufacturer practice ideal total compatibility always achieved least  midi standard  little meaning  r standard interface  little history midi fairly recent innovation standard first proposed fortunately realized unless someone something chaos would prevail musical instrument industry course resultant loss sale never forget midi spawned manufacturer user later past year many electronic instrument introduced keyboard synthesizer example probably familiar people machine analog device  pitch sound produced determined linearscaled control voltage generated keyboard advent microprocessor became feasible produce digitally controlled instrument eliminating inherent instability inaccuracy analog control approach please note term digital analog used describe method control totally different meaning applied technique used generate sound discussed section hardware anyway important instead keyboard produced varying voltage keyboard produce discrete code like computer keyboard must digress moment present short discussion element tonal music tonal music distinguished atonal music ie noise described constituting three determinant parameter note comprised pitch harmonic data volume loud soft sounded note duration long note sounded digitallyencoded keyboard capable generating discrete quantity one parameter note determined key pressed however duration determined measuring long key pressed known time base volume little tougher measure pressure key hit necessarily require analog measurement however measure time moment key begin depressed moment fully depressed know fast key travelling give good indication hard struck measurement beginning key travel end key traveltime called  velocity  provides third parameter midi instrument use analog pressure measurement generate velocity data three parameter recorded realtime transmitted instrument would possible reproduce original performance exactly musician played technique offer major advantage analog recording technology none degradation sound inherent analog recording process first device attempted store reproduce parameter familiar everyone oldfashioned player piano captured key press realtime stored paper piano roll later retrieval evolution electronic instrument resulted various scheme electronically store parameter however early attempt  sequencing  process coding storing retrieving note volume duration data individually developed manufacturer  compatibility different brand instrument rare nonexistent midi standard originally proposed provide single standard used instrument manufacturer varied different instrument could function together however shown later midi evolved considerably beyond basic note definition  language  little technical data wo nt reproduce full standard readily available variety source necessary understanding basic principle application midi midi synchronous digital protocol data sent bit word k baud using current loop yet another format good ole r sitting every computer existence official party line r top speed k slow handle note data current loop necessary suppress interference would result long cable run could excuse sell hardware hmmmmmm anyway back fact midi protocol consists control data word may byte long certain situation longer midi defines three parameter previous section follows note note defined note follow standard eventempered chromatic scale note defined specific frequency permitting performer tune instrument required volume primary mean specifying volume velocity see previous discussion velocity quantized per note discrete step softest loudest also parameter control relative volume entire instrument duration midi handle duration note two parameter note note note generated key pressed note generated key released two command sent independently note issued corresponding note sent data error mechanical failure poor programming note sound forever instrument turned present occasional problem particularly live performance communication protocol data error sometimes happen midi provide  note  command stated duration must measured known time standard midi provides midi clock signal sent specifically designated data byte midi divide musical beat midi clock midi also defines following parameter program change parameter selects different  patch  sound musical instrument program numbered  note patch defined midi standard program might violin one synthesizer barking dog another channel midi provides different channel midi command data specific single channel ie instrument global pitch bend name implies pitch note  bent  real time remember jimi hendrix modulation control parameter usually effect vibrato sound note though instrument programmed use modulation data control parameter modulation pitch bend usually controlled instrument wheel lever performer rock back forth sustain sustain pedal piano cause note sound pedal control device released midi spec allows different control parameter although small number currently identified standardized addition midi provides  system exclusive  message manufacturer assigned unique  sys ex  code allows implement custom feature without interfering manufacturer customizations ah ha say nt defeat purpose  standard  yes extent remember manufacturer equipment pushed standard allows innovation differentiation brand stated earlier must admit standard considerably consistent  standard  r interface preceding constitutes broadest description midi protocol quite feature nt covered however general idea kind data midi handle tell way midi used midi used ok established midi communication protocol note definition language control instrument musical instrument thought two distinct component sound producing component control component example keyboard piano fret guitar button clarinet thought control component piano string hammer guitar string acoustic body magnetic pickup electric clarinet reed hollow body sound producer first application midi permit separation control sound production component common though midi controller keyboard keyboard generates note note data well various control data see previous section pass sound producing section sound producing section could synthesizer digital sampler drum machine midi equipped sound producing device synthesizer combine sound producing device keyboard controller single physical package however midi permit two addressed two distinct separate section single musician single keyboard play many different instrument simultaneously two way first place several different sound producer channel responding midi data time process called  layering  used produce full rich harmonically complex sound effect several different instrument playing unison second technique called  splitting  keyboard  arbitrarily assigning specific channel specific note keyboard permit different instrument play different music control one musician one keyboard example musician might assign bottom two octave keyboard channel rest keyboard channel digital sampler set reproduce sound bass assigned channel synthesizer producing piano sound assigned channel musician able play bass line accompaniment left hand playing piano lead right note instrument layered unlimited number instrument may played however keyboard split maximum number instrument may controlled limited maximum number midi channel  sequencer another obvious application midi storing midi data stream later playback  process known sequencing task may performed either dedicated piece hardware called course  sequencer  general purpose computer equipped appropriate software interfacing sequencer allow editing midi data  wrong note corrected new material entered one note time section rearranged moved copied much like word processor almost sequencer allow transposition changing key tempo change  autocorrect  note played exactly beat eliminating sloppiness playing since midi provides unique channel different instrument controlled simultaneously allowing sequencer function like multitrack tape recorder instrument  played  sequencer individually different channel part entered sequencer play back time effect creating oneman band oneman philharmonic orchestra finally since midi developed professional semiprofessional musical tool several feature required recording supported sequencer allow form tape sync basic form tape sync sequencer provides synchronization signal laid one track multitrack tape recorder new track laid sequencer synchronize previously recorded material make multitrack recording overdubbing similar recording trick much easier midi spec also defines midi song pointer thought  mile marker  music sequencer support midi song pointer capable automated punchin punchout  process inserting new material previously recorded track librarian software one us manufacturer midi instrument make system exclusive command data dump literally  dumping  parameter data needed define sound setup midi line command software store data later recall called librarian software librarian limited merely storing

lately midi also found application nonmusical function eg controlling mixing board stage lighting sound processing equipment reverbs digital delay etc problem midi powerful tool midi totally without problem follows cautionary note already mentioned midi defines note duration two separate data command note note possibility note transmitted without corresponding note following always present danger data get garbled transmission line become unplugged midi standard utilizes pin din connector nasty habit loosening socket channel accidentally get switched etc without note command note continue sound ever major annoyance recording session annoying occurs onceinalifetime hot set live performance well get idea various manufacturer come different solution problem common button pressed produce note command course silence offending note silence note process two note note onnote structure intrinsic midi spec live occasional stuck note midi transmits k baud little math show midi capable sending approximately note per second obviously musician ever play however divide capacity among channel add data stream produced controller pitch bender modulation wheel throw program change good measure possibility overrunning data honest never heard happening possibility still midi instrument contain midiin jack receiving data midiout jack transmitting data midithru jack passing midi data along another instrument instrument daisychained together perceivable delay develops first last instrument chain infamous  midi delay  may heard delay eliminated using device known  midi thru box  active
