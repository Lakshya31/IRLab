date thu feb subject dial back nt always secure usenet via anonymous donor increasingly popular technique protecting dialin port ravage hacker sinister system penetrator dial back operation wherein legitimate user initiate call system desire connect type user id perhaps password disconnect wait system call back prearranged number assumed penetrator able specify dial back number carefully protected even able guess usernamepassword pair penetrate system anything meaningful except type username password connected system correct pair assumed worst could happen spurious call legitimate user harm might even result security investigation many installation depend dialback operation modem principle protection penetration via dial port incorrect presumption way penetrator could get connected modem call back call unless able tap directly line called back ala assumption always true compromise design modem telephone network unfortunately make possible clever penetrator get connected call back call fool modem thinking fact dialed legitimate user problem area follows caller control central office many older telephone central office switch implement caller control release connection calling telephone called telephone exclusively controlled originating telephone mean penetrator simply failed hang call modem central office typed legitimate user username password modem would unable hang connection almost modem would simply go onhook situation notice connection broken line used dial call came modem went dial call legitimate user back might notice standard way electrically penetrator still connected line mean modem might attempt dial wait answerback tone far end modem penetrator kind enough supply answerback tone modem heard system modem dial could make connection penetrate system course modem incorporate dial tone detector ringback detector fact wait dial tone dialing ringback dialing fooling recording dial tone dial tone generator chip pose little problem trying call ringing line modem dumb enough pick ringing line attempt make call fact could used system penetrator break dial back security even joint control called party control central office penetrator would merely dial dialout line would work even separate line long penetrator able obtain number modem dial technique waiting dialing complete supplying answerback tone could used course technique supplying dial tone modem waited would work calling dialout line would work especially well case software controlling modem either disabled autoanswer period dialin dialback thus allowed line ring action taken allowed modem answer line autoanswer enabled paid attention whether line already connected tried dial ring window however even carefully written software fooled ring window problem many central office actually connect incoming call line line go hook call come without first put hz ringing voltage line make ring ring voltage many telephone central office supplied asynchronously every second every line incoming call answered incoming call reach line instant end ring period line clairvointly responds going hook may never see ring voltage mean modem pick line dial penetrator dial may see ring voltage may therefore way knowing connected incoming call rather call originating circuitry switch even switch always ring connecting incoming call modem window going hook originate call ignore transient ringing voltage assumption originate goingoffhook process author aware central office reverse battery polarity voltage line answer condition distinguish originate condition mean universal modem take advantage information supplied summary thus impossible say certainty modem go hook try dial line accept incoming call really connected switch actually making outgoing call relatively easy system penetrator fool tone detecting circuitry modem believing seeing dial tone ringback forth supply answerback tone connects penetrates system security depend sort dialback recommendation dial back using line used dial secure made completely secure conventional modem use dithered random time delay dial dial back combined allowing modem answer wait period provision made recognizing fact nt originated call perhaps checking see modem originate answer mode substantially reduce window vulnerability nothing completely eliminate obviously one happens connected older caller control switch using line dial dial isnt secure easy experimentally determine ought possible avoid situation dial back using separate line line modem dialing much better provided either dial line sterile readily tracable penetrator target system one way line accept incoming call unfortunately later technique far superior former organization concealing telephone number dial line long period involves considerable risk author tried order dial telephone line unaware special charge might made service even available final word warning year past possible access telephone company test verification trunk area country using mf tone called  blue box  test trunk connect special port telephone switch allow test connection made line nt disconnect line hang test connection
