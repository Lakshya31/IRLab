wgt graphic tutorial topic filled polygon chris egerter october introduction       series tutorial describes method drawing filled polygon using rendering technique solid gouraud shading texture mapping code tutorial written turbo c ported graphic library operating system use wgt function one wgtgfxc file contains routine needed demo decided explain method used routine since discover think learn code  polygon             start thing first define polygon polygon figure composed straight line number side may may closed discussing closed polygon article mainly allow fill interior colour open polygon edge drawn difference inside outside furthermore discus convex polygon draw horizontal line across polygon must cross exactly two edge given vertical position polygon pass test convex  drawing polygon horizontal line                       computer graphic screen comprised x axis coordinate  top left corner polygon consists number vertex contain x coordinate screen first task draw filled polygon given set vertex simple way fill polygon would draw line vertex making sure connect first last using region fill routine fill interior work case however slow useful program requires animation method draw series horizontal line make polygon  algorithm          reason dealing convex polygon simple knowing draw polygon using horizontal line simply store starting ending x coordinate horizontal line coordinate polygon nonconvex polygon would require several horizontal line per coordinate thing get bit complicated basic algorithm drawing polygon calculate starting ending x coordinate horizontal line coordinate using standard line algorithm instead plotting pixel store x coordinate array simply calculate line vertex connect first last vertex line close figure draw horizontal line given row two column see polygon may drawn using two simple well known routine line slope horizontal line  keeping track left right edge                        let define two array contain horizontal line coordinate routine assume using xx graphic mode however easily ported another mode changing number row mode int startx int endx polygon drawn value array set impossible number indicate point found coordinate following example use  impossible number would never used  scan converting edge polygon                        next step create routine calculate line store x coordinate every coordinate store x coordinate first check startx array  first point found row store x coordinate startx array continue line startx  mean point already found store coordinate endx array since already know row exactly two intersection polygon code routine void polyline int x int int x int  calculates coordinate line given two vertex x x use fixed point math speed thing x coordinate multiplied row constant added x simplified version line algorithm store x coordinate every coordinate  int tmp long x  nt horizontal line   make sure greater  tmp  swap coordinate  tmp tmp x  swap corresponding x coordinate  x x x tmp x long x  multiply  long x x long  fractional amount add x coordinate every row equal delta x delta word x coordinate change x x column row  x   always skip first point every line done   want store point two line meet twice would result single point drawn   go row   coordinate screen  startx    store first coordinate  startx x else endx x  store last coordinate  x   add constant x   calling polyline routine                  next need write routine go vertex list call routine complete draw horizontal line first let make structure vertex segment
