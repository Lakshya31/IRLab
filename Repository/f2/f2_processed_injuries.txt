geometry five minute long nt go sleep yet second topic type range injury caused blast portion bomb cover injury caused strictly overpressure throwing body static pressure injury hurled object injury collapsing building third topic cover immediate burn caused heat bomb secondary burn item ignited bomb fourth topic ionizing radiation prompt immediate secondary fallout many film see effect nuclear weapon based experiance gained hiroshima nagasaki people say nothing learned since today weapon hundred thousand time powerful film informative understand bomb sherical phenomenon people used thinking linearly   etc sphere nt like let look math bit one dimension addition     etc want increase distance reach stick increase length stick factor word double distancereach double length triple distance reach triple length ten time distancereach ten time length simple everybody understands however  two demensions talking area multiplication x x x x x etc term  squared  used number multiplied squared squared squared squared  etc think pouring bucket paint flat floor figuring many can paint need cover larger circle single would cover want increase size circle going paint use formula circle area area pi time radius time radius pi x r x r  x rsquared circle one unit radius foot meter yard whatever need  x  amount paint cover area  x x  x  circle radius increase factor need time  x  amount paint  x x  x  three time radius need time  x  amount paint  x x  x  ten time radius  x  amount paint  x x  x  little difficult three dimension lose people sleep prone try wake talk math bit still using multiplication figure volume box multiply height time width time depth v h x w x calculating volume shpere take four divided three time pi time radius time radius time radius volume  x pi x r x

take megatonage new bomb divide megatonage old bomb take cube root result multiply time radius blast effect example compare kt  mt  kt mt  divided  cube root  xx therefore take blast effect x foot

look hiroshima kt say okay mt kt bomb well  time time well  cubed  effect one mile gz hiroshima effect  mile mt blast effect heat effect cover later okay question right end math wake okay let talk blast injury avoid confusion need talk overpressure staticpressure dynamic pressure think overpressure think barometer normal air pressure psi overpressure simply air pressure excess normal atmospheric pressure overpressure would cause empty sealed crushed side dynamic pressure wind dynamic pressure figure use calculate horsepower sail sailboat damage caused wind resistance dynamic pressure proportional square wind speed density air behind shock front nuclear blast air density quite high looking wind speed alone nt give entire story also duration dynamic pressure come effect dynamic pressure would cause empty sealed blown next county think sheet plywood placed perpendicular parallel blast front ignoring time take overpressure get front back plywood overpressure nt much damage contrast sheet hit broadside sideways dynamic pressure note duration many thing take great stress short period time example fast blow fuse pas ten time amperage rating fraction second overpressure lung injury occur pressure would cause harm pressure second two ok injury human caused blast talk injury specific effect talking single effect real life victim might lung damage broken
