guy asked get digitized macintoshª sound modem play phone line conversation lion roaring call customer service sort thing  simple answer canõt done modem donõt necessary digitalanalogconverter dac circuit voicemail unit like dovefaxª another story every mac dac builtin itõs beep boings insult talking mooseª need connect phone month ago posted circuit would let connect macª almost phone circuit since iõve emailed countless letter thanks well two folk asked òwhy canõt louder ó òwill work stereo sound newer mac ó òhow use home stereo walkmanª ó òwhat meaning life universe everything ó answer question read                                  stereo louder original mac compact model seª series lowcurrent audio output jack worked well amplifier didnõt enough oomph technical term drive headphone first circuit devised matched output phone system wasnõt particularly loud worked mac newer mac powerful output jack modified circuit use power boost voltage going phone time doubled could use pick side stereo sound theyõll mono end phone line course connect phone stereo amp tape player circuit fit mac tell plugging pair headphone back play stereo full volume use circuit ii sound kind wimpy use circuit  donõt leave phone plugged                                 circuit read even youõre building version description apply youõll want circuit like ê iõve included radio shack stock number able find equivalent item electronic store hackerõs closet plug   mini plug fit mac compact mac older mac ii model mono output use conductor plug  switch singlepole doublethrow switch  good possibility use knife switch threeway wall switch block switch model train abandoned bought computer transformer key whole thing keep mac phone companyª interfering donõt use one youõll probably disable phone service lowpower  audio transformer work rip one baud modem youõve meaning toss get  four buck get radio shack transformer cut scotchª tape wrapped around free four wire wire color match diagram capacitor isnõt necessary transmitting sound let hang phone otherwise phone system think transformer active telephone get film ceramic capacitor rated least  µf volt slightly higher rating arenõt problem   µf volt good choice electrolytic capacitor wonõt work speaker optional using sound output mac disables internal speaker pull plug turn speaker back wire substitute  small lowpower speaker like one baud modem wonõt loud internal speaker could good thing youõll also need hookup wire extend component reach telephone use bell wire  anything else basement radio shackõs shelf                                 circuit ii build one ê part except transformer audiooutput stepdown one used backwards radio shack  job nicely youõll need two theyõre cheap plug stereo òringtipsleeveó one  match newer mac walkpersons use  home stereo amp rip cord pair nonfunctioning headphone left switch speaker drawing circuit add want also leave one transformer youõre dealing mono circuit donõt tie tip ring plug together harm mac transformer color code might change follow simple rule note one side transformer two wire three twowire side connects mac threewire side face phone middle wire threewire side doesnõt connect anything note white wired white green wired green even use transformer different color two side stereo circuit must match otherwise stereo sound mangled mono one disappear entirely                                 construction macõs audio output standard phone system lowvoltage special wiring technique arenõt needed solder twist wire together neatly insulate connection electrical tape even duct tape scotch tapeª bandaidsª doesnõt matter wire go speaker capacitor youõre using stereo plug circuit ii notice middle wire go tip plug top wire go ring partway plug bottom wire go plugõs sleeve follow color code ñ youõre using switch ñ make sure wire mac go switchõs center connector put whole mess box make look pretty used part old intercom speaker switch already built                                 connection mac end easy plug jack speaker icon like one ê choice come telephone end directly phone jack open jack wall itõs low voltage youõll see least one red one green wire connected screw terminal connect wire transformer either screw capacitor screw directly phone youõve got standard nonelectronic nonmemory phone open trace wire coming back theyõll connect two screw terminal marked l l connect two wire circuit screw doesnõt matter go plug get phone cable like  standard modular plug one end four short wire coming connect transformer capacitor red green wire plug modular end standard phone jack modular yconnector multiline phone office phone thick cable multiline connector look like scsi plug get  adapter use method digital phone ñ found office building ñ require special jack look bottom office phone thereõs òringer equivalent numberó òrenó stamped itõs digital use method touchtoneª phone arenõt necessarily digital office telecom manager help get right jack keep laughing uncontrollably describe want                                operation make phone call play sound mac donõt hear sound telephone handset flip switch set volume sound control panel
