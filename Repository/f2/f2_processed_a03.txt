programmer guide ibmpc le familiar assembly language probably want assembly language guide ibmpc instead program invocation invoke must provide program invocation line either typed console do command prompt appears included batch file program invocation line consists following program name name source file want assemble may use wild card delimiters wish denote group source file assembled sort matching name alphabetical order wild card specification file assembled order even get jumbled within directory identifies end source file name see name extension name default object extension com bin obj described shortly sorry source file default object extension  may optionally provide word separate source file name output file name name output program provide extension assume one following extension obj invoked switch linkable object file production b bin switch org program c com otherwise want program file extension end file name period option omit program file name symbol table file

output file name may intersperse assembler switch setting anywhere program name acted upon immediately matter command line switch discussed detail elsewhere summarize c cause assembler output symbol

c duplicate microsoft masm mx switch  c cause assembler consider case letter within nonbuiltin symbol significant assembly output thus example define different symbol x x c duplicate masm ml switch cause default base numeric constant decimal even constant leading zero cause default base hexadecimal leading zero decimal otherwise e cause errormessageaugmented source file written yournameerr

enhance masm compatibility first three expense program size number n sum number option selected example l select option numbered cause generate longer byte instruction form unconditional jmp instruction forward reference local label eg jmp l normally assumes since local label nearby short byte form work option code usually longer necessary spared occasionally go back code explicit jmp

reference default setting switch  minus  multiple switch specified single sign eg ox ox environment variable allow customize assembler examines msdos environment variable named   invoked variable content inserted invocation command tail typed example execute command set aox do typically autoexecbat file run computer started x switch  plus  unless overridden  minus  setting command line  may also include one file name environment variable file always assembled first file specify command line allows set library macro definition always automatically available program thus example do command

standard input may safely skip section also configured take command argument standard input addition invocation command tail environment variable allows used menudriven system nt generate command tail program also allows program create list file assembled  pipe  list feature work command argument ampersand prompt standard input ampersand seen thing following ampersand ignored example place list file name switch setting file called filelist invoke assembler via filelist cause content filelist file used command line may place ampersand end environment variable prompt file name whenever invoked without command argument type followed immediately enter key msdos prompt mode used menu system cant generate invocation command tail note redirect standard input come file read line file limit byte substitute space line break thus may give file name individual line readability however feature invoked manually redirection typing line prompt take first line need give switch file one line  strategy source file maintenance encourages modular programming letting break source separate file complete impunity concern whatsoever file break  treat sequence file single source code stream consider one following strategy adopted source file management name source file extension found file particular extension chosen    choose common asm source file designed msdos assembler nt like  would suggest keep separate subdirectory hard disk multisourcefile program simple command    performs assembly current directory program exploit fact expands wild card alphabetical order whenever want source file assembled first eg contains variable declaration append decimal digit start file name first file second etc however many file need explicitly ordered file need come last append  z  start file name accommodate strategy programmed somewhat complicated algorithm determining default output file name use name first source file truncate first character decimal digit however may generalpurpose file must come first provided following exception source file whose name begin digit   name without used nt like always explicitly give program name want   myprog  system requirement requires msdos v later bios lowerlevel call made run msdos machine please let know find case small program fairly flexible memory us assemble small file k byte memory beyond program current version k byte  total k byte beyond operating system memory capacity symbol table size source file size output file size use k byte memory  noted smallmemory system severely limit size source file remember nt hurt badly split source file impunity assembles sequence file single source stream similar include facility assembler
