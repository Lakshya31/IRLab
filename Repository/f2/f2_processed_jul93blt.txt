csl bulletin july connecting internet security consideration bulletin focus security consideration organization considering internet connection spurred development high speed networking technology national research education network nren many organization individual looking internet mean expanding research interest communication consequently internet growing faster telecommunication system thus far including telephone system new user internet may fail realize however site could risk threat intruder use internet mean attacking system causing various form computer security incident consequently new internet site often prime target malicious activity including break in file tampering service disruption activity may difficult discover correct may highly embarrassing organization costly term lost productivity damage data new existing internet user need aware high potential computer security incident internet step take secure site many tool technique exist provide site higher level assurance protection internet internet worldwide  network network  use tcpip protocol suite communication component network interconnected various point provide multiple route destination high

terminal emulation remote system access telnet file exchange ftp electronic mail smtp number service information exchange outlined csl bulletin tcpip osi choosing strategy open system nist advises

government business academic site cracker often roam internet impunity covering track moving system system intruder known use system illegally exchange copyrighted software obtain sensitive information business secret general cause mischief system administrator often unaware breakins unauthorized user learn accident number factor contributed state affair complexity configuration many site connect system internet little thought complexity system administration increased potential abuse internet new system often arrive  box  network access control configured maximum ie least secure access access control usually complex configure monitor result control accidentally misconfigured result unauthorized access ease spying spoofing vast majority internet traffic unencrypted therefore easily readable result email password file transfer monitored captured using readily available software intruder known monitor connection wellknown internet site purpose gaining information would allow crack security steal valuable information information sometimes permit intruder spoof legitimate connection ie trick system security permitting normally disallowed network connection inherent problem tcpip protocol tcpip protocol suite implemented internet contain provision network security number tcpip service eg rlogin rsh etc rely mutually trusting system inherently vulnerable misuse spoofing ironically service eg ni nfs widely used coordinate local area network security distribute system resource among local system vulnerability service exploited security local area network could badly compromised wideopen network policy many site configured unintentionally wideopen internet access without regard potential abuse internet system still employ passwordless guest account anonymous ftp account written without restriction others keep sensitive information networkaccessible system easily read vast majority site permit tcpip service require operation attempt limit access information computer could prove valuable intruder recommendation new existing internet connection new existing internet site need take strong specific measure improve computer security measure

secure gateway secure gateway firewall highly effective improving site network security secure gateway collection system router placed site central connection network whose main purpose restrict access internal system secure gateway force network connection pas gateway examined evaluated secure gateway may restrict access selected system block certain tcpip service provide security feature simple network usage policy implemented secure gateway provide access internal external system little access external internal system except perhaps email small site simple router packetfiltering capability may serve effective gateway type router typically restrict access selected system service examining packet according sequence filtering rule flexible robust approach combine router system capable logging network access restricting access service finer basis secure gateway implement proxy service require ftp telnet connection first authenticated gateway allowed continue without secure gateway site security depends entirely collective security individual system number system increase becomes difficult ensure network security policy enforced error simple mistake one system configuration cause problem interconnected system securing modem pool unrestricted incoming outgoing modem pool including pabx system create backdoor would let intruder get around access control secure gateway modem pool need configured deny access unauthorized user system accessed modem pool require strong authentication onetime password modem pool configured outgoing connection unless access carefully controlled securing public access system public access system anonymous ftp archive often prime target abuse system misconfigured allow writing permit intruder destroy alter data
