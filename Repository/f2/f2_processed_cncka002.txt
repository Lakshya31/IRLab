transcript interview mr brian mee concerning famous backyard rifle photograph       introduction       tuesday august met mr brian mee home better part three hour discus famous backyard rifle photo seem show oswald wearing pistol belt holding rifle one hand radical newspaper hand three backyard photograph currently evidence labeled ce b c show oswald figure different pose although dallas police said found two negative one one b b negative known exist important backyard snapshot discovered late house select committee assassination hsca conducting investigation photo known demohrenschildt much clearer printed full negative prior interview supplied mr mee page extract file photoszip time available compuserve jfk assassination forum file contains hsca testimony two member committee photographic panel calvin mccamy cecil w kirk testified defense backyard picture also supplied mr mee section photo two book dispute authenticity meeting ran hour minute give take minute recorded

white   general comment   mccamy possibility fakery  mr mee stated opinion expressed speaking behalf government agency reader notice interview read several lengthy section kirk mccamy testimony explained mr mee went tape would reading extensively extract order provide would read transcript necessary context background one issue would like consult mr mee theory backyard photo could faked explaining theory drew diagram referred throughout explanation point interview wished video taped well audio taped reader might find somewhat hard follow mr mee explanation without able see diagram referring say however think one still get general idea mr mee saying subject following interview mr mee spoke professional photographer photo lab technician well serious experienced amateur photographer know question answering related kennedy assassination posed question relation hypothetical photo doll someone yard came issue water spot nearly straight line run across oswald chin simply asked chance edge water spot would form nearly straight line people consulted included following mr konrad mandl professional photographer photo lab technician certified member british institute professional photography miss davette johnson professional photographer photo lab technician computer graphic technician mr jerry finzi professional photographer mr mark loundy professional photographer mr arthur kramer professional photographer taught photography collegiate level addition mr kramer wrote column modern photography magazine year called  view kramer  mr steven newbould photo lab technician harrogate photographic laboratory harrogate england professional serious amateur spoke corroborated mr mee view issue asked example mr mee expressed considerable skepticism photographic panel claim irregular line across chin actually edge water spot line appears jack white video nearly straight mr mee said one reason doubted panel assertion miss johnson told year photography never seen edge water spot form nearly straight line mr mandl said would unusual edge water spot form nearly straight line similarly mr kramer stated occurrence would  unlikely  mr mee disputed photographic panel claim vanishing point analysis could explain conflicting shadow backyard photo discus subject miss johnson mr mandl question photographic source issue response quite revealing asked vanishing point analysis could explain facial body shadow hypothetical doll fall direction asked assume facial shadow fell straight body shadow fell approximately ten oclock position see backyard snapshot every single one insisted described shadow variation possible without two different light source none expressed view variant shadow could explained vanishing point analysis mr mee said film grain pattern backyard photo could matched forger knew took care match film speed mr mandl agreed skillful forger could match film grain pattern composite picture mr newbould said believed grain pattern could matched fake photo added wanted information commenting question mr mandl mr newbould two person asked comment topic             mr mee qualification             mr mee professional photographer photo lab technician worked photography year worked photographer photo lab technician u government last ten year among thing mr mee studied onthejob training negative retouching print development shadow negative analysis addition technical course color print development color negative development winona school photography affiliated professional photographer america school also course automatic printing using computer video analyzer kodak school photography rochester new york mr mee asked make clear view expressed speaking behalf government agency            transcript interview            mr mee mtg watch segment demohrenschildt photo jack white video fake forged photo framed lee harvey oswald segment demohrenschildt photo superior detail clarity indicate taken different better camera mtg right thing demohrenschildt photo copy much better detail larger background make sense mr mee would nt copy detail anything reverse would true since always lose never gain copy something lose detail definition contrast built start lose gray tone hold detail start go shadow tape unclear would nt copy demohrenschildt photo would copy mtg could printed negative even though better contrast everything mean jack white seems think demohrenschildt photo better quality must made better camera logical assume taken better camera mr mee two possibility come mind one  done better camera one earlier copy negative second thirdgeneration copy say demohrenschildt photo done better quality camera possible likely situation probable two choice mtg let see sounding far audio tape stopped rewound played back check sound quality mr mee mtg watch jack white video segment frame edge marking scratch could produced mtg comment mr mee one comment theory oval cutout area filled figure cutting oval inserting body head  think would difficult accomplish without leaving telltale sign youre allowing many area tampering detected multiplying suspected area whole bunch opposed putting head tape unclear would little bit easier could done retouch large area think would picked would leave many telltale sign wouldnt really agree mtg first way white suggested making exposure edge marking combining composite photo mr mee yes could done feasible something like process sandwiching though might little difficult hide say couldnt done dealing another negative probably different characteristic idea negative shot edge marking edge marking  something like would difficult achieve took film wound across ir camera without making exposure developed negative clear type well call overlay could combine picture instead actually shooting type picture ir camera see otherwise soon  even cap  soon open youre still going get type trace different negative could sandwich together talking making print working print copying possibility something along line would nt go far say could done fashion mtg possibly took film dragged across film plane aperture snap picture took film would given overlay mr mee yes would give acetate overlay clear film develop since nt struck light come clear could place composite onto acetate overlay make print copy print different camera would possible mtg would mr mee one thing keep mind copied print ir would multiple streak edge mark would probably shadowing type effect ghosting type effect get one another one close even tried drag film camera exactly done think would still able pick slight variation mark microscope mtg okay mr mee mtg view jack white video segment fact photographic panel omitted nose earlobe chin measurement backyard photo penrose study mtg comment mr mee pretty much said last time nt kind study leave relevant measurement surprised chin measurement nt considered guy panel knew chin picture disputed area according article gave mtg oh yes knew chin disputed long time mr mee uhhuh well make harder understand could left calculation mtg could done chin thing threw total measurement much mr mee let put way nt know would left measurement especially chin thing mr mee mtg view jack white video segment idea demohrenschildt photo somehow produced without ir camera negative backyard photo could made prior made ir camera mtg comment mr mee quite possible mtg demohrenschildt picture indicates backyard photo could made made ir camera better camera used mean mr mee think know getting start talking highquality camera talking lens much camera would use high quality lens copy thing want try reduce aberration contrast thing go inferiorquality lens copying youre already losing something nt want lose anything else use best type lens get thats consistent would normal practice picture worked would copy picture expensive camera preserve much quality possible edge marking talking original type negative rather original type print full negative say would original print original negative could take print copy would still get edge marking would printed full negative case demohrenschildt photo would difference whereas picture might seeing full print time would certain amount cropping edge done quite often automatic printer look picture say  wait second person hand cut see negative  pretty customary mtg much picture negative would one usually expect cropped mean like going give percentage would say would cropped percent ten percent mr mee well ca nt really say depends format depends lot factor depends machine using depends enlarger using operator using get back format example say got mm negative get mm print full negative  instance x  pause people nt x frame x frame happen blown go cut edge situation would cut percent picture one example cropping come play lot variable hard say mtg okay mr mee would say normally copying picture want crop enough ca nt see edging attempt try get much original picture possible trying get fullest picture possible without edging get much possible cut really close youd want crop enough could nt see whatever edge would nt want able see edging picture texture fiber mtg move area right saying position presence frame edge marking scratch alone absolute proof backyard photo authenticity mr mee right convinced marking prove photo nt doctored mtg okay next area mr mee mtg view jack white video segment oswald expression backyard photo white view person picture could gone smile frown without noticeably moving surrounding facial muscle mtg comment mr mee well nt think significant piece evidence every person different degree youre smiling frowning ever subtle facial muscle nt change much muscle would nt necessarily noticed photograph granted big grin would change lot different thing would change smile line way light hit kind shadow would created big frown difference expression two photograph appears ever slight hard tell without looking enlargement original possible frown smile retouched could retouched mtg hsca photographic panel said different expression  smile frown  showed head pasted onto separate photograph mr mee right well possible mouth retouched head photo could head nt think argument alone strong argument saying head appears photo thing compelling evidence head used mouth could retouched could one photograph taken oswald head picture could used photo could use two head easily could use one would nt change problem lighting characteristic shadow two photo head used photographed one setting head position picture mtg right oh way interesting kirk mccamy criticized jack white use overlay order detect smile frown used overlay mr mee yeah mr mee smile noticeably say mtg okay let see copy extract oh yes like ask two thing mentioned evidence head used namely difference eye puffing lower lip frown argument evidence head nt mr mee well could make argument ruling possibility two head used difference eye would indicate one photo head used looking photograph hard tell mr mee point mouth eye pause examine photo could look segment want see part show head enlarged mtg sure portion video segment showing head enlargement replayed twice mr mee look book copy photo mr mee see slight difference eye ca nt say thing could nt retouched either really wish mtg including oh sorry mr mee go ahead mtg including eye eye could retouched mr mee eye could retouched hand looking negative trying determine photo go negative one thing look subtlety smile change ever slightly possible one photograph oswald head used hard tell picture looking original could make better determination looking enlargement video copy photo guess would two picture head used head photographed around noon one head put tilt nose eye shadow overlooked idea two head picture used would logical assumption nt say mouth eye couldnt retouched enough create difference id really look original mtg okay mccamy also brought fact lower lip mtg okay got cut going ask puffing lower lip mr mee yes really nt say whole lot term whether retouching one photo head used mtg okay got another segment like show mr mee mtg view jack white video segment stance figure backyard photo mtg okay problem center weight also stance figure reversed  comment mr mee well sure exactly mr white trying say pointing granted figure standing awkward position regardless head head nt seem bearing person standing maybe trying point nature photography catching subject instant say people stand walk around time complete balance feasible see people balance photograph time figure backyard photo could shifting weight starting walk taking step backwards lot different thing could done make stance look odd look odd mind certainly look odd nt know say stance natural mtg claim figure center gravity lie outside weightbearing foot actually case would mean mr mee well moot point people nt always stand perfectly balanced see time dont know exactly suggestion body retouched way problem dont know someone went length fake photograph  nt know would need retouch leg upper body mr mee mtg view jack white video segment conflicting body shadow mr mee watch segment video segment shown several time mtg comment mr mee well something definitely wrong body shadow nt see quite difference mr white see difference nt know would say one body shadow right ten oclock one right twelve oclock mtg well think phrasing difference term approximation word saying one perfect ten oclock position right twelve oclock position let watch segment mr mee okay video segment reviewed mtg see mean mr mee right okay said see difference body shadow seem made different time day wanted make every possible allowance body movement camera movement could see could perhaps say time difference picture matter minute several minute far body shadow made could see could reach conclusion mtg uhhuh mr mee shadow cast head neck  look odd mtg mr mee well shadow neck look narrow head  nt know shadow angle much nt b c shadow cast neck thicker b c could real shadow mind look little mtg uhhuh mr mee hard say though would really help could look original could real shadow saying looking seem little strange mr mee mtg view jack white video segment fact c body shadow run onto fence whereas body shadow b nt mtg comment mr mee well say photograph taken within second think impossible much variance direction body shadow body shadow definitely changed position c photograph  without looking original  could cause shadow running onto fence would figure little farther back got consider lean weight shift c leaning back could cause shadow go onto fence would nt take much shift lean make go onto fence dont think unreasonable amount mean see standing front bright light see much change length shadow leaning little bit mtg okay body shadow fence head going onto fence could due slight shift lean mr mee right way think suggestion two different people used wearing clothes really unlikely nt think would used two different body especially one different height mtg right make sense mr mee mtg view jack white video segment blurriness righthand finger mtg okay blurriness finger right hand mr mee well yeah way appears could caused couple different thing could moving hand light might reflecting newspaper shadow area hand would take away detail around finger hand slightly angled ever slightly reflection newspaper would make finger look stubby likely possibility nt know retouch artist would tampered anything area mtg yeah think would guy hold newspaper would nt retouching mr mee right mtg okay next segment well let take look mr mee mtg view jack white video segment white finding enlarged figure match oswald height foot inch length rifle long brought rifle size match alleged murder weapon official size  inch figure appeared six inch short mtg okay thought mr mee person height could different would another indication fraud photo nt know would used standin much shorter oswald though think would gotten someone oswald height mtg along line one oswald impersonator said two three witness quite bit shorter oswald mr mee huh interesting well examine mr white methodology closely reached conclusion though kind comparison got figure factor like whether tilting camera person standing relationship object picture sort thing mtg figure look like leaning tilted much mr mee well say figure doesnt look like leaning point would hard determine height appears standing pretty much straight nt know exactly camera held would nt guess held way balance look picture phone ring tape recorder placed pause mtg hang phone interview resumed recorder accidentally left pause minute mtg realizes tape recorder still pause mtg okay little snafu let ask opinion jack white work overall mr mee well overall say pretty good nt agree think reading much certain thing general think right track mean everything seen far copy everything looked far would say made valid argument mtg well know british photographic expert mentioned video jeffrey crowley looked white work quite impressed mr mee uhhuh yeah remember mean guy jack white make mistake overall make pretty good case mtg okay fair enough mr mee mtg view jack white video segment conflict backyard figure chin oswald chin line go one side neck across chin side neck mtg okay think bracket issue shape chin got lot picture oswald going clear back junior high high school day show sharp cleft chin know testimony mccamy said found picture oswald youth chin little broader slightly flat even congressman fithian nt convinced nt found case photo oswald youth nt issue anyway since backyard photo supposedly show oswald adult photo oswald adult show sharp cleft chin like return issue chin later discus mccamy claim edge chin disappears shadow mr mee okay mtg also like hold discussing line across chin review mccamy argument caused water spot right mr mee fine mtg wanted show segment provide background get issue minute mr mee right mr mee mtg view jack white video segment conflict nose shadow neck body shadow nonmovement nose shadow even head tilted mtg comment mr mee well think area get convincing evidence photograph doctored  lighting characteristic see photograph nose eye shadow match neck shadow nt match shadow fall body either nt match one sun thats problem even two sun light still could produce difference shadow backyard photo think thing panel photographic panel cited substantiate photo arent nearly important shadow characteristic mtg going ask later long subject mccamy instead dealing problem shadow appealed vanishing point analysis never actually got around explaining nose eye shadow drop straight hand big patch light left side neck body shadow c falling ten oclock position instead dealing headon problem appealed vanishing point analysis get later right id like ask think analysis kind overrule able see photo far contrasting shadow mr mee shadow different angle show shape area cover nt  got dealt directly form analysis going convince shadow different shadow group mtg okay mr mee let give little background say lot way alter shadow photography situation figure outdoors day one light source way shadow photo could occurred time day could argued reason light neck getting reflection newspaper b c newspaper side mtg patch light still mr mee still still consistent nt neck side shadow consistent eye nose shadow nose shadow stay vshape coming straight onto upper lip head tilted tilt head would nt see big difference nose shadow would see difference shape angle would change nose shadow nt look like head tilted mr mee mtg view jack white video segment two unnatural bulge backyard photo one neck post b fact bulge parallel mr mee see video segment replayed several time mtg bulge comment bulge fact parallel could retoucher might goofed neck spotted decided move goof post hope moved background image would le noticeable mr mee even good retouchers sometimes make small error see bulge see mr white talking go along theory composite photograph would required retouching mtg photographic panel report well panel apparently hard time explaining bulge post theory panel put writing indentation optical illusion caused shadow twig mtg okay let go going read explanation given photographic panel could perceived indentation post ce b believed undersigned illusion resulting location shadow branch leaf along edge post okay said problem mr mee well problem keeping mind angle body shadow others branch leaf would struck sun coming around four oclock position therefore branch leaf shadow would fall ten eleven oclock position dont think bulge could resulted natural shadow sun coming four oclock angle nt see bulge could caused shadow branch leaf angle right look part video mtg sure video segment replayed afterwards mr mee examines book xeroxed copy photo mr mee nt see bulge could caused shadow branch leaf nt see shadow angle would wrong sun wrong position like see original though small detail like want look original photo see really nt think bulge caused kind branch leaf shadow  sun shining way picture bulge neck explain nt see discussed anywhere extract mtg kirk mccamy nt deal nothing file photoszip nt know panel report deal either nt think panel tried explain offered explanation think groden livingstone would tried answer could wrong though kind hard believe would nt tried explain nt know still nt gotten copy panel report really nt know mr mee okay well neck bulge need explained nt look natural parallel bulge post disappears b indentation post b mtg uhhuh hsca testimony jack white suggested forger knife slipped caused post bulge could something like caused bulge neck mr mee possibly something definitely mtg oh wanted ask mccamy explanation indentation post mr mee right mtg let read referring computer printout produced digital image processing inspection lead u believe apparent indentation simply shadow look carefully see post running area slight darkening merely shadow mr mee nt think consistent direction sun picture consistent way bulge look mtg summarize saying sun according body shadow nt position could cause shadow would produce indentation post mr mee look mtg let know knowledge panel never identified leaf branch could possibly caused shadow simply said bulge could caused shadow leaf branch nt say leaf branch mr mee okay mr mee mtg view jack white video segment fact patch sunlight side house beside post holding stairway change shape backyard picture indicating camera making photo move horizontally patch light left post roughly parallel figure right elbow mtg nonmovement one shadow underneath stairway nt change shape position even though picture supposedly taken handheld camera say asking supposedly marina took first picture snap oswald came took camera advanced film handed back went back position camera process repeated third picture could patch light change way mr mee possibility patch light would stay position maintain shape movement remote need tripod even youd careful see video segment replayed several time mr mee think see talking look couple time video segment replayed two time mr mee okay let take another look picture really quickly mtg oh sure take time mr mee study picture approximately one minute mtg see talking mr mee yes would agree mtg would nt almost impossible using handheld camera especially given way picture supposedly taken mr mee would say would nearly impossible chance something like happening would astronomically small mtg right mr mee even using modern camera one would automatically advance film shot taking series picture chance achieving effect would low better still low mtg right mistaken think one segment mtg start play video tape realizes video segment mtg nope last segment mr mee right mtg okay little back got message compuserve gentleman named paul burke reference jack white secondary method producing frame edge marking photo said  copying photo assembled group photo others postulated using imperial reflex camera problem focus ability limited master montage would large couple foot  said last time nt argue mr mee right mtg okay continues  would sort granular discontinuity segment making sharp line cut etc etc  mr mee well know scenario mind talking mean first picture taken many copy talking appearance final product depend several factor going depend thing like quality original photo camera enlarging equipment material retouching lot thing would come play far size go probably would rather large photograph scenario composite  would rather big picture lighting picture backyard photo would guess used mediumspeed film many thing establish first made judgment also farther line go original quality going lose mtg okay mr mee another thing  picture grainy talking b c sharp lot texture grain plus got telltale line running across chin thing ie bulge neck indentation post b mtg right thing chin line across chin extract read mccamy positive line run one side neck crossing chin  line caused water spot panel whole however go far report say cause line definitely determined wanted ask thought mccamy explanation mr mee well reading problem mtg okay said problem mccamys explanation claim irregular line across chin caused water spot line jack white mention well mr mee well couple thing one thing sheer coincidence line happens fall chin area one edge one particular water spot supposed left deposit way form line coincidentally start one side neck cross chin end side  right oswald head could attached body mean would good place join head body composite chin area line region supposed water spot problem say statement line photographic image mtg start talking water spot talking say line nt photographic image mr mee right mtg line one jack white discus video one start one side upper neck cross chin go side neck mr mee right mtg give u context nt go ahead read exactly said line mr mee okay mtg let see mccamy fine line actually fine photographic image photographic image made silver grain grain distributed good idea size distribution line line much finer silver grain much continuous photographic line line photographed kind montage would grain pattern discontinuous line line quite continuous indeed follow line back around closed loop mr mee talk photographed  see picture  bearing grain negative emulsion grain characteristic film produced photographic print way  line line much finer silver grain much continuous photographic line   hold water looking print negative argument hold water mr mee read extract  line photographed kind montage would grain pattern discontinuous line  thats coming print need look would negative nt examine negative argument valid nt prove anything see grain characteristic negative print mean even forgetting part argument saying line nt grain pattern running line fine say getting grain would put emulsion like sandwich kind like two piece plastic water spot would sitting top think would obvious would doubt say line chin part closed loop im sort disadvantage nt exhibit using hard comment irregular line part closed loop caused water spot loop outline water spot line almost straight water spot nt normally edge like mean water spot well  spot usually oblique going long straight edge like see edge loop mean nt seem face looking picture see line across chin dont see telltale line face like know edge loop mtg okay like ask mccamys point concerning saw examined negative b negative phase contrast microscope let read part okay mr mee sure mtg reading extract examined negative phase contrast microscope would detect small change thickness negative nt come right say assume saying checked negative highpowered microscope nt find change thickness chin area negative mr mee well thickness negative necessarily going relevant saying original photograph could copied negative could made going see difference density negative negative came retouched photo mtg uhhuh oh let go back water spot second could wanted ask something else mccamy said mr mee okay mtg said  see water spot  extract word   missing obvious thats saying read obvious thats saying resume reading see water spot b see spot occurs first generation print negative know spot must negative comment mr mee well saying inconsistent he saying water spot negative print part photographic image unless see negative ca nt really say mtg record let read photographic panel said irregular line appeared scanned image b negative reading groden livingstone book high treason mr mee yes mtg let go ahead read book mr mee okay mtg quoting directly photographic panel report let see read page high treason carefully adjusted display condition scanned image oswald backyard negative exhibit irregular fine line chin area panel went say line probably caused  faint water stain  comment mr mee yes meant ask reference  line  single line line find mtg know honest nt know wondered mccamy mentioned one line found digital image scanning mr mee huh well far read would say evidence tampering nt accept idea line across chin caused water spot least stage nt nt seen exhibit show shape water spot mccamy say caused line surprised caused change mind nt think water spot would leave kind line mtg okay mccamy said examined chin area digital image processing nt find granular inconsistency mr mee well matched film speed using kind film common back would hard prove something either way back pretty much one way making film forger knew stuff knew kind thing would checked later guess would done best match grain characteristic would nt impossible access negative picture oswald head could done saying tampering pasting head onto figure chin could done well enough member photographic panel would able pick technology time mtg ah part looking could like read grain pattern one thing wanted study nature silver grain area chin chin allegation two different photograph way photographic scientist found nothing remarkable grain pattern type grain pattern mr mee forger matched film would nt noticeable difference grain digital image processing would inconclusive saying would easy process would depend negative picture head mtg match film mean mr mee right could done way film made back  pretty much one way making film  matched film speed assuming access negative head shot using could match film characteristic mtg position thing claimed observed digital image processing prove authentic photograph mr mee nt think digital image processing alone prove photograph authentic technology available back late nt think could proven nt know could done today  possibly scanning technology coming could would depend carefully forger matched film step went fake photograph lot variable mtg right vanishing point analysis layman read got impression nt want deal shadow angle resorted vanishing point analysis tried explain shadow problem picture  neck nose eye body shadow  vanishing point analysis let read context mr goldsmith mr mccamy panel address question shadow backyard picture mr mccamy addressed vanishing point analysis mr goldsmith mean  vanishing point analysis  mr mccamy sun distant far away consider infinity result draw line object shadow object number place scene line parallel line may recall ever seen photograph railroad track disappearing distance photograph show two rail converging point called vanishing point rail parallel photograph converge taught art course high school mechanical drawing converging parallel line wellknown matter perspective photograph one expect parallel shadow line converge vanishing point mr mccamy yes b line drawn part stairway past shadow stairway line drawn butt pistol shadow butt pistol arm shadow arm point photograph find meet point line pass nose chin one nose shadow nose one thing disputed frequently analysis properly see shadow lie right supposed lie thing true muzzle rifle shadow muzzle rifle line mr goldsmith mr mccamy line parallel would meet one point two exhibit mr mccamy mr goldsmith line two exhibit met one point conclusion inference might drawn mr mccamy might drawn conclusion something drawn rather traced hand nature mr goldsmith similar vanishing point analysis c mr mccamy yes mr goldsmith result mr mccamy result read however get little interesting mccamy asked sharp angle line analysis find jumped soon read mtg look extract second okay let read mccamy questioned congressman fithian guy ask challenging question fithian said morning listening carefully described vanishing point concept find fascinating wonder vanishing point line converge short distance chart look railroad even artist conception railroad track road sort narrow give impression talking know great distance yet sharp angle line bush nose rest come within foot chart could explain optical problem mccamy answer yes vanishing point may infinity parallel vertical line axis camera horizontal get parallel line course say vanishing point infinity slight tilt camera cause convergence would slight convergence start infinity begin move inward photograph saw vanishing point shadow substantially photograph photograph made later later day estimated picture taken  afternoon  picture made later vanishing point would continued move finally would within picture area sun moved behind photographer instance cite railroad track disappearing distance vanishing point picture seeing vanishing point think far go describing phenomenon vanishing point anywhere infinity right picture nt quite understand exactly mccamy explained fact angle chart sharp converged short distance mr mee well looked chart hard comment look see exactly talking line sharp angle sound odd need see chart could really form opinion really understand principle vanishing point nt think relevant case real issue conflict shadow another thing tell sun hit oswald face nt four oclock position also get deal absence shadow shadow got look shadow  study angle determine direction light source kind thing mean vanishing point analysis explain oswald nose shadow nt move change form photograph going explain seem two separate light source hitting body face going explain bulge neck post mtg okay disappearing chin mccamy said edge chin disappeared shadow problem trying explain fact backyard photo chin broad flat picture oswald  taken kind frontal viewpoint  chin sharp cleft mr mee disappeared shadow extent oswald would difference mtg okay mccamy saying oswald chin form vanished point picture look like broad flat chin mr mee would disagree sun position much affect appearance chin mtg uhhuh okay mr fithian bless heart problem part exchange mccamy mr fithian thing greatest difficulty term viewing photograph squareness chin wonder mr chairman could ask multiple photograph chart half dozen oswald plus two could put back let preface question saying sitting looking exhibit visually least identify chin even approximately square one backyard photograph  picture put could see hate return already done still puzzle trouble seems one strongest point critic misshape chin want make sure understood testimony testimony light shadow combination overhead sun whatever mr mccamy yes mr fithian understand correctly mr mccamy yes went bit fithian continued mr fithian photo two large blowup righthand photo testimony point chin obviously nt disappear  find difficult believe changing teeth mouth position really make much difference  point chin disappears shadow chin layman term saying happens photograph mr mccamy yes lower part chin illuminated nt see disappears shadow mtg accept mr mee well thing possible instance position sun mtg mr mee position sun mtg yeah mr mee well sun overhead left mtg based body shadow mean mr mee yeah sunlight coming four oclock position nt see could made much chin disappear mean underside chin shadow edge nt vanished form chin still mtg sun came right around twelve oclock position mr mee well explain side neck nt amount shadow body shadow fall right mtg uhhuh mr mee mean anything seems like chin term width even ignore flat mtg yeah think mr mee look would say chin serious problem mtg uhhuh okay like ask fact panel found small variation distance object background picture given way photo supposedly taken seem possible mr mee variation would greater photograph taken way marina said mean like showed video snap picture oswald walk take camera advance film hand camera back go back assumes another pose aim camera take picture go process third photo way camera would moved tiny fraction inch even professional photographer trying hold camera still possible going variation distance talking picture mtg jack white mentioned small difference distance could produced keystoning think mr mee oh think right demonstrating keystoning effect video exaggerating little bit help understand talking he got right idea would simple matter tilting easel little bit mean slight movement enlarger easel could cause kind difference talking mtg okay stereoscopic analysis said analyzed photo able view stereoscopically let read mccamy said able view photograph stereoscopically know slight camera movement know two picture much far reaching consequence tell u solid three dimensional field photographed two time one photographed background taken camera photographed print rephotographed print two angle viewed stereoscopically human eye would tell looking plane print nt saw saw depth still see depth one going art work actual stereo pair art work done exceedingly meticulously slightest difference art work one photograph art work photograph would cause point involved appear far away close would tend float space stereo viewing excellent way checking authenticity photograph mr goldsmith special viewer necessary enable someone see stereo mr mccamy necessary make convenient people mr goldsmith many panel member examined photograph stereo mr mccamy least oh half dozen mtg thought mr mee slight movement enlarging process copying process think could get different perspective photograph would cause effect nt prove nt convincingly say picture authentic mean think one time looked little child viewfinder seen cartoon slide reason get looking two different eye seeing result slight movement print print cartoon slightly moved  print looking viewfinder got two print moved slightly give effect slight movement print case photograph mtg backyard photograph mr mee right case slight movement enlarger copying process could get right amount difference photo would able view stereo mtg okay one thing really like ask demohrenschildt photograph frame edge marking actually nt involve frame edge marking involves matching demohrenschildt photo ir camera film plane aperture talked briefly last time jack white testified committee house select committee mr mee uhhuh mtg okay involves finding edge marking edge demohrenschildt photo determination photo genuine marking unique ir camera jack white testified back said well let read said read page high treason demohrenschildt picture show much larger amount background around edge photograph b c indicates demohrenschildt picture printed full negative fact verify printed black border around edge black border clear area around edge negative according fbi picture ceb identified taken oswald camera could matched film plane aperture yet demohrenschildt picture show larger background area taken camera viewpoint b c cropped therefore background area picture demohrenschildt photo could possibly matched film plane aperture understand point mr mee yes mtg explain layman term think he right mr mee well certain thing know could say whether right put way demohrenschildt photo lot background b negative taken camera viewpoint yes would tend tell mr white correct make precise measurement demohrenschildt picture b negative compare also need know taken camera viewpoint want good uncropped print b negative kind thing need check could really say anything white say mtg video jack white suggests demohrenschildt photo composite made border film plane aperture ir camera mr mee see segment mtg yeah video segment located tape replayed mr mee explanation see saying going sort line demarcation way around would easy identify let put way would difficult cover extremely difficult cover line like would almost impossible mtg okay get back point fact much clearer mr mee earlier generation one cropped mtg right would gotten two scratch mark onto demohrenschildt photo mr mee well get picture could made tell think might done mr mee start draw diagram using square represent picture andor negative present explanation point back forth different square instance refers  one  say   point certain square say something like  one  point different square etc etc see thinking group backyard photograph made long demohrenschildt photograph point earlier group composite first picture first one would taken highquality camera highquality camera first picture high quality okay mtg uhhuh mr mee group would taken picture using highquality camera picture group would smaller first one example way road b c taken okay every time along way losing generation mtg uhhuh mr mee never tell may couple generation photo early stage talking background  one highquality picture backyard get first picture include figure holding rifle newspaper okay mtg right mr mee may original dont know many could existed stage introduce one two head retouch print photograph print come print negative picture print could retouched negative could retouched make print negative introduce stage photograph either generation two okay got photo  theyve art work done reworked using highquality camera photograph one photo ir camera make example demohrenschildt picture would give edge marking scratch mtg would happen analyze say negative photo right digital image processing stuff done mr mee well got remember picture head included grain pattern photo  one talking  going dependent film used negative photo head know kind film use let say saw film used head oh  speed kodak pretty common film back speed might even le would sure use speed kodak shoot print background guy standing rifle newspaper key would keep film consistent throughout would important would extremely difficult technology time detect little difference would process talking late seventy mtg mr mee right nt think technology back able discern small difference kept film consistent today possibly sophistication computer scanning capability coming might able spot difference late seventy nt think capability detect long maintained consistency film photo blend together like anything else process gradual enough going blend right think photograph could made mtg think one forger mr mee think would needed team group professional mtg like show couple doctored print released dallas authority mtg show mr mee two print show white human silhouette oswald supposed whitedout figure corresponds closely size outline figure backyard photo mr mee right well somebody something nt prove done print might represent early attempt produce backyard photo never know see thing though nt believe picture made like would much area retouch even good retoucher head area would small area worry mind print might part process could done way would done forger probably looked several different option making photograph would looking best method print could one way considered mtg right like ask varying exposure analysis mr mee well understand theory trying mtg go ahead read little bit first mr mee sure mtg okay going read mccamy said mr goldsmith please explain result varying exposure analysis mr mccamy yes illustration greatest exposure give darkest print least exposure lightest print advantage lightest area picture see detail seen conversely shadow best photograph look detail print ideally exposed look shadow one ideally exposed look highlight see detail mr goldsmith applying method panel discern anything unusual picture mr mccamy nothing allegation shadow painted simple examination shadow picture show plenty detail see grass little stone newspaper lying back see detail comment mr mee nt think issue mean nt think shadow added nt time study picture long enough give firm opinion area see  without looking original  nt think shadow added talking altering exposure see detail shadow black white print different grade lightness darkness full spectrum called zone system full spectrum  whitest white blackest black camera film pick zone well let say sliding scale camera might get white white might get really dark dark nt get everything altering exposure lighten dark area see detail nt explain problem different shadow angle bulge post neck mtg right mr mee still question shadow neck head look little odd might due using different head shadow bush stairway  nt see retoucher would bothered would taking unnecessary risk really tend agree mccamy see nt think shadow added mtg okay mr mee saying analysis explains shadow angle neck post bulge would disagree going explain away problem sort analysis mtg seems easiest way explain different body shadow would assume photographed different time day mr mee yeah think taken different time day see understand guy conspiracists saying situation took picture scene took picture person studio somewhere else put figure picture youd need add shadow agree mccamy nt think shadow added would lot easier put head body mean could put anybody picture could take picture background body everything take head put figure would lot easier mtg okay know talked quite bit last time like ask reenactment mccamy cited show nose shadow could remain even head tilted already discussed reenactment detail forum jfk assassination forum compuserve like get view mr mee begin shaking head side side typical   motion right well pause continues shake head mtg well know even congressman fithian pointed chance thing would occur time low fithian referring manipulated unrealistic head camera movement done reenactment mr mee yeah well let put way nt realistic bottom line nose shadow shifted head tilted mean head tilted like would nt drastic change youd get enough movement could easily spot difference way shadow look like mtg okay let see let see find okay picture side two third tape run portion follows reconstructed note taken mtg mtg showed mr mee note conclusion interview mr mee said accurately reflected said mtg like show picture gerald posner book case closed picture show grain structure analysis done right side oswald face would take look tell think mtg show mr mee bottom photo sixth page picture posner book mr mee study minute mr mee see variation grain pattern however would nt form opinion looking copy picture nature book would need study original highpowered microscope could see grain structure forger matched film given fact part one standard way making film would nt expect see big difference grain anyway film fact matched would difficult reach definite conclusion grain term authenticity backyard photo mtg mccamy recognized mr scott photograph fake shadow suit nt match shadow railing mccamy explained mr scott fellow panel member spent hour assistant preparing fake photograph man standing backyard presented photograph mailed pulled envelope pulled envelope said fake rather surprised easy turned done make photograph foot photograph foot man placed backyard photographed thing caught eye instantly shadow cast part dark suit shadow cast part railing immediately behind man suit full sunlight exactly matched railing shadow suit nt match shadow railing would way would true photograph read thought strange man gone great length dismiss implication variant shadow backyard photo yet admitted concluded mr scott picture fake shadow nt match opinion matter mr mee mccamy saying thing scott photo others said backyard picture consistent inconsistent shadow photo clear indication fakery mccamy absolutely correct immediately branding mr scott picture fake based conflicting shadow one sun shadow conflict backyard photograph least serious telling head body photographed sunlight taken two different time day mtg think argument good forger would done pasting different part body stomach chest mr mee one thing order attach upper body onto someone else lower body stomach chest area would match shirt width exactly would need maintain consistency wrinkle fold came joining point would ensure two person build figure compatible also larger object attaching harder hide pasting also matter figure pose order attach oswald upper body onto lower body forger would needed picture oswald arm hand necessary position would needed photo hand held way rifle newspaper could inserted pasting abdomen lower would also present problem build figure would compatible would increasing size object attached thus making even harder hide pasting chin area would logical place joining number reason people natural cleft indentation form chin beneath lower lip notice line across oswald chin run area joining  head onto chin object attached would small much smaller part man upper body neck would another place pasting could done object attached would still relatively small least compared upper body would need neck identical size shape mtg finally would say summary backyard photograph mr mee convinced fake show impossible shadow shadow conflict serious telling way backyard photo could identical even nearly identical background taken manner described marina oswald figure chin oswald chin readily apparent even accept claim line across chin caused water spot would change fact chin noticeably different oswald chin neck bulge post indentation indication tampering mtg would like thank coming tonight taking much time answer question mr mee quite welcome pleasure
