recpyrotechnics welcome anyone interest subject experienced trying get started hobby getting started try get hold much information subject read carefully explosive interested make sure read theory behind explosive lot misinformation movie etc regarding explosive important get good background reliable source pyrotechnic literature section several book mustreads anyone serious pyrotechnic try local library even nt book mentioned sure information subject remember never wellinformed safety stake aware aspect involved extremely dangerous pyrotechnic explosive safe factory destroyed past access best material equipment take stringent safety precaution people net also injured accident many year experience took extremely comprehensive safety measure knowledge chemistry physic essential nt highschool chemistry get chemistry textbook read make sure understand basic principle involved composition might making good idea check recipe someone experienced chemistry make sure havent missed safety aspect take time find information put safety others highest priority find pyrotechnic extremely fun rewarding hobby reading recpyrotechnics  often see interesting composition method posted recpyrotechnics temptation run try immediately however sometimes information posted contain error omit important safety aspect sometimes people post method heard vague source think work havent tried leave couple day see anyone net responds get printout read several time make sure completely familiar question correction article please nt hesitate post people net would much rather answer question may seem  silly  get hurt posting recpyrotechnics  composition method served well please share net also question people happy help however please remember message going read lot people around world many may familiar aspect posting include relevant safety information example possible mixing storage hazard toxicity expected behaviour composition ignited etc post something nt tried sure make clear
