stone wood simple frame make abacus uneducated could quickly trained use th th century note rise arabic numeral system slowly spread europe civilized world although superior calculating system arabic numeral required user understand complicated numerical theory associated system early napier often associated development logarithm practical application introduced series rod could used multiplication crude slide rule system soon ever complicated  calculating engine  primitive mechanical computing device appeared one example complex pascaline invented blaise pascal stage set babbage english mathematician inventor help ada byron daughter lord byron famous poet developed idea two mechanical calculator  number engine  difference engine device solve polynomial equation method difference analytical engine never built designed general computing device mechanical concept using gear rod cam perform calculation unfortunately neither machine built since tooling machining technology day imprecise could construct accurate part needed however model planning babbage byron lead important preliminary computing concept still use today aside note work babbage byron computing even infancy strongly influenced woman men let face computing gender specific next jump united state problem arisen united state census time took year process information gathered census bureau since tabulation done hand paper assumed census might take year tabulate clearly better method needed crunch volume number data public competition held produce better indexing mechanical system tabulate future census result herman hollerith census employee handily suggesting use punch card form punch card reader tabulated result six week hollerith wise way computing device seeing good opportunity went found tabulating machine company later changed ibm hollerith might thus thought first computer entrepreneur advent world war ii provided impetus development refined computing device mark
