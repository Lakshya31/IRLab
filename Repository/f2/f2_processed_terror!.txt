flying hermit time man life get mad someone time get real mad someone time vengence better way get back someone damaging hisher car thing saved worked hard paid yes item must attack time parked outside easily accesible night important asshole want annoy method describe relatively easy safe set effective causing damage method destruction explosion explosive device already inside car factory installed use standard volt car battery let look princleple behind exploding battery familiar theory battery work nt probably young thinking sort thing anyway within battery current flowing positive negative actually negative positive another story also small internal resistance resistance inside battery order magnitude roughly  ohm amount small usually ignored normal operation battery case interrested closed circuit battery closed circuit internal resistance becomes big deal following hold true volt ohm amp amazing causing short circuit closed circuit battery produce amp current running little bugger however current short lived battery handle capacity long therefore battery explodes explodes rather large force causing considerable damage pressure flame hurling lead goody combined volatile liquid hidden inside engine cause vehicle add another member big junk yard sky great know make car blow nt want go hte car need triggering device one go simple elaborate incorporating sophisticated device radio transmitter purpose opt simple timer relay device first need heavy cable capable handling massive current without melting need relay also able cope large current next need timer count second triuphant vengance finally small battery run relay small battery run relay timer using digital timer  h j connect small battery timer timer relay relay car battery connect heavy duty relay car battery heavy cable remember tinkering people property nono officer friendly might get ugly see forewarned also car battery dangerous play handled improperly may explode unintentionally
