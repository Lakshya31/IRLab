john bedini developed two kind controller device one simple one present quite bit complex would impossible reproduce  anyway want see electronic controller get book  bedini free energy generator  john c bedini published tesla book co magnolia ave millbrae ca time man looking different way generate electricity used water power steam power nuclear power solar power recent paper written tom bearden make free energy generator possible tom bearden rather patent device chose share people open ear many conversation tom bearden found tom one reasonable men ever dealt energy field others would tell story great machine would never present truth circuit diagram look machine question tom hand clearly present idea clearly present idea discloses concept mean work fact present free energy never put textbook portion textbook grounded people conventional theory made thing complicated explain simple anyone understand theory anyone understands build device grounded conventional theory eleven year

tricked battery different space time relationship simply put suppose battery never work full charge left suppose becomes possible stressed terminal way ion battery electrolyte actually move backwards machine unit make possible many different name people call unit generator energizer alternator etc conventionally device one thing common stress battery backwards pushing electricity battery forcibly pushing ion electrolyte backwards theory going push anything ion going move recharging battery go little deeper theory probably asking  madman talking  simply put going put stress battery terminal moment time battery rest come heavy part theory nt teach textbook order battery charge two oscillatory action must occur one positive terminal one negative terminal different stress level force ion backwards would occur electron machine slingshot ion battery electrolyte backwards beyond normal recoil action must give stern warning time voltage developed high battery explode use utmost care test setup lab proven dangerous build device experiment unless know use utmost caution struck sharp voltage spike electrolyte battery resonate certain frequency also force ion backwards simply put battery motor energizer become resonant point  ring  like bell  strike  ringing energy developed note sorry ca nt produce waveform get book present explanation however battery really charging ion electrolyte stressed curved space time relationship battery actually forced believing work ever occured oscillatory action taken place energizer pulsed  slingshot  immediately let go happened electrolyte battery go wild ion race backwards giving hydrogen oxygen gas must make stern warning time stimulaing pulse important time long battery burn pulse time short circuit fails operate correctly battery never recover charge taking consideration failure could occur would controller failure due point faiulre electronic controller multivibrator latched   position electronic controller anyone studying see used little energy get point gained lot resonant energy return must remember battery applied energizer longer normal must burn excess energy keep battery cool problem becomes one embarrassing excess energy shortage energizer also simple machine yu want make complex simple way study alternator principle wave want generate like came old dc generator exception armature drag bearing drag excited field also would want cut magnetic field degress armature simpler better going throw idea way run test lab discovered certain type energizer generator alternator need also want able tune output energizer old dc generator put something close towhat need except drag ac generator output going see manufacture would appear leaf generator really make generator output change rectifying looking ac generator rectified output see could become useful u energizer simply easiest construct principle simple done experiment ac generator using n alligned magnet rectified people see type alternator might problem however remember looking certain type wave form want tune certain frequency certain speed winding alternatr problem bit tricky chose stay unit may choose different method retain principle type energizer used prototype standard office type speed ac fan housing coil replaced coil approx turn wire phase six permanent magnet bonded aluminum disc arrangement basically magneto produce amperage
