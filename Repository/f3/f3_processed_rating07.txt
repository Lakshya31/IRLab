removed remark similar especially product provoked large quantity comment done minor editing grammar spelling sent monstrous compendium series              monstrous compendium good many typo mistake plain inconsistency must used rather carefully mc binder format embarrassingly poor artwork lot misprint well rather inconvenient use monstrous manual mc needed binder good monster needed index monstrous compendium principle nt bad idea usual delivery sucked cheap paper easily ripped simply opening closing binder separate monster front back sheet made alphabetical sorting impossible numerous typo ever fix breath damage black dragon complete index complete monster summoning table monster level rating system st edition book fine update nd edition course eventually would put demonsdevildaemons back without stupid name happy mc stuff useful somewhat necessary ive reorganized three hole mc sheet sorta sad tsr going away format monstrous compendium series something could never get seems nt durable enough combined problem multiple creature per sheet thing ca nt really kept alphabetical order multiple book creature nt seem bad anymore liked mc binder format part sane standard monster every dm favorite old standby always wondered nt put binder mc series  mine full appendix although divider useful notebook school  monstrous compendium outer planar appendix mc                         outer plane nasty though developmental stuff mc  even entire planescape setting boxed set couldve done ten page le ok contains  ultrapowerful monster  character ever able touch like solar however  big bad guy  balor pit fiend wimpy monstrous compendium fiend folio appendix mc                         ff appendix marginally interesting use mostly idea monster creation module    temple tower tomb great module imho original wizard challenge quite good fun play nice mystery unfolds well fairly scripted allows enough flexibility keep thing working interesting dm player also nice job emphasizing many roleplaying aspect magic user wizard challenge ii unfortuanately interesting predecessor straight forward adventure however bad cleric challenge hand absolutely horrible module allows minimal roleplaying pit pc many many horrible creature single pc level specified survive  must quite npc ally go whole idea  challenge  series individual pc creates havoc dm player alike adventure far disastrous adventure ever misfortune played actually never got finished historical reference           highly recomend tsr best work oh viking book come first note berserker useful everything else sort dull charlemagne one great problem book became apparent list character legend charlemagne useful better  roland ogier high turpin level also make one mistake section roncesvalles  turpin survived although gravely wounded well legend anyway celt book absolutely fabulous however modification celtic mythos book adopted wholesale tsr qv planescape sort suggests necessity revision legend lore book mighty fortress continues mistake charlemagne paladin made stats major npc  even mention fictional character mentioned back book want know ninth level fighter could take three muskateers although nt ask historical reference would definitely like see book exclusively exploration america oriental historical reference book africa india two article dragon recently viking rome helped section campaign world similar culture mighty fortress almost advanced timewise fit campaign contain valuable material anyone wan na bet next one oriental card deck      deck marginal use advanced player use lowmagic campaign easy losemisplacescatter refuse pay money spell card include new material sorry thing nt convenient neat idea make personally use spell deck product go seem reasonable value seems spell cardsitem card serve little purpose beyond making money tsr card spell magic item absolutely fabulous keep book searching especially combat absolute minimum speed game along infinitely also since dm try keep lot secret player give magic item card keep dmg spell card nice idea problem arise lot addition spell cr deck ok unneccesary take lot space liked idea practice bombed card unsual size big carry way lack specific table holding case small card causing mix move around transport ca nt really say familiar  deck   say saw promptly pretended nt exist nt missed either nt rate nt buy b nt want admit accessory      treasure map true dog run adventure straight oneshots however good story skeleton idea kernel base real adventure score get raised somewhat may even break buy treasure chest one day see anything spark good idea adventure battlesystem accessory             battlesystem skirmish one pointless accessory ever seen basiclly ad hit instead hp anybody could easyily come rule skirmish nt even speed mass combat much battlesystem rule great set rule fantasy wargames flaw point system many wargames flawed point system rule converting character work well implemented campaign mass battle occur player screen         fighter screen would better extra sheet screen ca nt think single reason could possibly want buy player screen moronic  player kit  tsr come seen screen detail whole idea bad totally superfluous foolish reason priest screen mostly sucked thief screen kinda sucked fighter screen brought lack quality ranger paladin section nt care convenient table player simply screen screen symbolizes isolation inherent dm power hey pas english player able hide sheet roll behind screen separated screen think le like party would hard use miniature viewed directly overhead due screen etc nt think completely appropriate rank player screen since obviously aim different market sector must say even much younger playing would never bought product better new player pack would embarrassed even carry around  least someone bought screen might use screen almost worthless thing information le  hour generally screen useless meant hide character player classspecific  end
