little progress hope new feature make worth dcgames system give game author ability write complete adventurerole playing game without write line code draw graphic create music sound effect etc also give ability allowing trim modify extend replace part system want accomplished several mean game system give complete set landscaping character object graphic tile use create adventure without draw registered user use graphic block editor trim modify extend replace tile specific need game system support generic sound blaster adlib sound music card includes good set prerecorded sound effect use trim modify extend replace sound effect well add recorded voice character mood seting music game system support vga supervga graphic card tie specific graphic mode decide resolution want use game run supported resolution regardless resolution created game provides complete set rule script implementing character class object type magic different type world etc script language enables change every aspect game complete control every character object world game almost every single aspect game play controlled script modify fit requirement think main benefit dcgames system complete control game longer wait add new feature choose wait wait lot le since new feature mind likely implemented using script already working additional enhancement like file io allow read write data file script control container object able put multiple thing container carry container example chest bag magic book etc lineofsight testing implement dark area cant see well prevent player seeing thing behind wall example light darkness night day well place need light source see like cave animation character move according hisher schedule even around animation individual character form moving figure move one place another character walk instead must jumping one square another likely use sprite set graphic block displayed one sequence add idea list many idea sent user actively creating adventure roleplaying game one rule must always remember rule feel free try something new nt stick current definition adventure role playing game mean cant figure something matter strange give call worst thing happen tell ca nt done best thing might easy nt might add idea list maybe one day easy want thank sent registration hint specially took time send idea constructive criticism plain kudos reason keep working wee hour morning hope enjoy creating adventure roleplaying game please send copy game write sincerely david hernandez dba dc software general information dc software graphic adventure game builder tool allow create graphic based adventure role playing game minimum effort programming knowledge basic premise dcgames artist story tell want create world story take place piece complex puzzle game player must unravel catering casual user well serious game developer system provides maximum flexibility providing complete set world character object element configure combine ease serious developer modify predefined element changing rule universe fit hisher particular need create totally new type world character object well control almost every aspect game play world character object adventure customized many different way provide uniqueness essence creation increasingly complex way customize game configure world character object extensive set attribute example big difference battleaxe cause point damage reach square requires hand wield weight pound laser gun cause point damage reach square requires hand wield weight pound energypak operate ammunition yet two object different attribute set create object using dcworld program script need something work little bit different modify default script much want example default script allow wizard use weapon weight pound need one hand could change allow wizard use edged weapon weight le pound add new class existing object character world type example class weapon currently defined blunt edged missile could create new weapon laser like missile weapon reflective armor work would also add reflectiveness attribute armor type also extend default script add new type could create new character type thief get better chance detecting hidden trap nt wear heavy armor usually get better price bargain create bomb type cause extensive damage object character area explodes ultimate customization create brand new script handle need single world character object specialized script allows create truly professional game main character story would personalized script see probably good idea learn script indispensable need learn write script right away let first look building block provided default attribute behavior see probably write game without writing single line script fact strongly suggest put writing script game place done work go back determine part game could use specialized handling hardware requirement dcgames  requires least vga card possible run system lesser graphic device creates logistic nightmare
