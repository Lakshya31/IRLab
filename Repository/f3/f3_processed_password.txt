password security case history encryption computing robert morris ken thompson abstract paper describes history design password security scheme remotely accessed timesharing system present design result countering observed attempt penetrate system result compromise extreme security ease use april password security case history encryption computing robert morris ken thompson introduction password security unix timesharing system provided collection program whose elaborate strange design outgrowth many year experience earlier version help develop secure system continuing competition devise new way attack security system bad guy time devise new technique resist new attack good guy competition vein competition long standing manufacturer armor plate armorpiercing shell reason description follows trace history password system rather simply presenting program current state way reason design made clearer design understood without also understanding potential attack underlying goal provide password secu rity minimal inconvenience user system example want run completely open system without password password option individual user able require user password gain high degree security penetration system unauthorized user password system must able prevent access system unauthorized user ie prevent logging must also prevent user already logged thing authorized called  superuser  pas word example especially critical superuser sort permission essentially unlimited access system resource   unix trademark bell laboratory password security course one component overall system security essential component experience shown attempt penetrate remote access system astonishingly sophisticated remoteaccess system peculiarly vulnerable penetration outsider threat remote terminal along communication link well computer although security password encryption algorithm interesting intellectual mathematical problem one tiny facet large problem practice physical security com puter communication security communication link physical control computer loom far important issue perhaps important control action exemployees since direct control may intimate knowledge system resource method access good system security involves realistic evaluation risk deliberate attack also casual unauthorized access accidental disclosure prologue unix system first implemented password file contained actual password user reason password file heavily pro tected either read written although torically technique used remote access system completely unsatisfactory several reason technique excessively vulnerable lapse security temporary loss protection occur password file edited otherwise modified way prevent making copy privileged user experience several earlier remoteaccess sys tems showed lapse occur frightening fre quency perhaps memorable occasion occurred early system administrator ct system mit editing password file another sys tem administrator editing daily message printed everyone terminal login due software design error temporary editor file two user interchanged thus time password file printed every terminal logged lapse security discovered everyone password must changed usually simultaneously considerable administrative cost great matter far serious high probability lapse going unnoticed system administrator security unauthorized disclosure password last analysis impossible system example content file system put magnetic tape backup must anyone physical access tape read anything restriction many program must get information various kind user system program general special permission read password file information password file actually distributed replicated number file updated whenever user added dropped system first scheme obvious solution arrange password appear system difficult decide done encrypting user pas word putting encrypted form password file throwing away original password one typed user later try log sys tem password type encrypted compared encrypted version password file two match login attempt accepted scheme first described pff also seemed advisable devise system neither password file password program needed protected read anyone needed implement idea find mean encryption difficult invert even encryption program available standard encryption method used past encryption message rather easy invert con venient rather good encryption program happened exist system time simulated cipher machine used u army world war ii turned program usable given key cipher produced program trivial invert much difficult matter find key given cleartext input enciphered output program therefore password used text encrypted key constant encrypted using key encrypted result entered password file attack first approach suppose bad guy available text password encryption program complete password file suppose also substantial computing capacity disposal one obvious approach penetrating password mechanism attempt find general method invert ing encryption algorithm possibly done successful result come light despite substantial effort extending period five year result proved useful penetrating system another approach penetration simply keep try ing potential password one succeeds gen eral cryptanalytic approach called key search human being strong tendency people choose relatively short simple password remember given free choice people choose password restricted character set eg lowercase letter often choose word name human habit make key search job great deal easier critical factor involved key search amount time needed encrypt potential password check result entry password file running time encrypt one trial password check result turned approximately  millisecond pdp encryption algorithm recoded max imum speed take essentially time test encrypted trial password password entire password file matter col lection encrypted password perhaps collected many installation want check password length n con sist entirely lowercase letter number password sup n suppose password consists printable character number possible password somewhat le sup n standard system  character erase   line kill  char acters example prime candidate immediately estimate running time program test every password given length char acters chosen set character following table give estimate running time required pdp test possible character string length n chosen various set character namely lowercase letter lowercase letter plus digit alphanumeric character printable ascii character finally ascii character one conclude great matter someone access pdp test lowercase alphabetic string length five given access machine say several weekend test string six character length using program collection actual encrypted password substantial fraction password found another profitable approach bad guy use word list dictionary use list name example large commercial dictionary contains typi callly  word word checked five minute noticeable fraction collection password found improvement extension found determined bad guy  good  thing try dictionary word spelled backwards list first name best obtained mailing list last name street name city name also work well initial uppercase letter valid license plate number state take five hour new jersey room number social security number telephone number like author conducted experiment try deter mine typical user habit choice password constraint put choice result disappointing except bad guy collection  password gathered many user long period time single ascii character string two ascii character string three ascii character string four alphamerics five letter uppercase lower case six letter lowercase additional password appeared various available dictionary name list like total  sample password fell one class course considerable overlap dictionary result character string search dictionary search alone required five minute run produced one third password user could urged forced use either longer password password chosen larger character set system could choose password user anecdote entertaining instructive example attempt made one installation force user use le predict able password user choose pas word system supplied supplied password eight character long taken character set consisting lowercase letter digit generated pseudorandom number generator sup starting value time required search pdp character string length character alphabet year unfortunately sup need looked number possible output random number generator bad guy fact generate test string found every one systemgenerated password using total one minute machine time improvement first approach slower encryption obviously first algorithm used far fast announcement de encryption algorithm national bureau standard timely fortunate de design hard invert equally valuable fact extremely slow implemented software de implemented used following way first eight character user password used key de algorithm used encrypt constant although constant zero moment easily accessible made installationdependent de algorithm iterated time resulting bit repacked become string printable character le predictable password password entry program modified urge user use obscure password user enters alphabetic password uppercase lowercase shorter six character password larger character set shorter five character program asks enter longer password reduces efficacy key search improvement make exceedingly difficult find individual password user warned risk cooperates safe indeed hand prevented using spouse name want salted password key search technique still likely turn password used large collection pas word seemed wise make task difficult possible end password first entered password program obtains bit random number reading realtime clock appends pas word typed user concatenated string encrypted bit random quantity called salt bit result encryption entered password file user later log system bit quantity extracted password file appended typed password encrypted result required remaining bit pas word file modification increase task finding individual password starting scratch work testing given character string large collection encrypted password multiplied sup reason encrypted version password one picked le random system modification likely bad guy spend day computer time trying find password system hundred password find none important fact becomes impractical prepare encrypted dictionary advance encrypted dictionary could used crack new password millisecond appear inadvertent side effect modif ication becomes nearly impossible find whether person password two system used password unless already know threat de chip chip perform de encryption already commer cially available fast use chip speed process password hunting three ord er magnitude avert possibility one internal table de algorithm particular socalled etable changed way depends bit random number etable inseparably wired de chip commercial chip used obviously bad guy could chip designed built cost would unthinkable subtle point login successfully unix system neces sary dialing type valid user name correct password user name poor design write login command way tell interloper typed invalid user name response invalid name identical valid name slow encryption algorithm first imple mented encryption done user name valid otherwise encrypted password compare supplied password result response delayed onehalf second name valid immediate invalid bad guy could find whether particular user name valid rou tine modified encryption either case conclusion issue password security unix probably better system use encrypted password appears reasonably secure absence serious atten tion expert field also worth effort conceal even encrypted password unix system instituted called  external security code  must typed dialing system logging code changed periodically someone old password likely prevented using whenever security procedure instituted attempt deny access unauthorized person wise keep record successful unsuccessful attempt get secured resource ofhours visitor computer center normally must identify record usually also kept entry wise precaution make keep record attempt log remoteaccess time sharing system certainly unsuccessful attempt bad guy fall spectrum whose one end someone ordinary access system whose goal find particular password usually superuser end someone wish collect much password information possible many system possible work reported serf frus trate latter type experience indicates former type bad guy never successful recognize timesharing system must operate hostile environment attempt hide secu rity aspect
