identification move toward future bruce j brotman special agent section chief automation research development section fbi identification division rhonda k pavel computer system analyst automation research development section fbi identification division one law enforcement today could deny year ahead bring many change challenge profession witness transformation already taken place regard economics demographic politics technology factor already major implication law enforcement every reason believe impact continue profound effect current trend development indicate year come fingerprint identification play much wider role law enforcement fbi identification division pursuing strategic plan rebuild improve essential service criminal justice user fbi operation new system providing greatly expanded fingerprint identification service provide immeasurable benefit law enforcement user nationwide automated fingerprint identification  evolving technology early fbi realized future identification division would closely tied ability incorporate automated technology fingerprint processing operation subsequent research development r initiative identification division produced first step toward fingerprint automation ensuing year commercial company ventured field fingerprint automation fingerprint identification technology flourished grew sophisticated several manufacturer developed automated fingerprint identification system afis integrating automated print latent processing capability one system company introduced concept  livescan technology  revolutionary new process requiring neither inked card chemical many identification division contributor capitalized emerging technology initiate automation project acquired afiss however simple expansion automated capability provide cureall problem traditionally plagued criminal identification effort technological improvement afford law enforcement newer advanced tool performing job ability execute fast efficient nationwide criminal search remains deficient primarily guiding standard ensure compatibility among dissimilar afiss manufactured competing commercial vendor although many state automated system inability communicate incompatible afiss severely limit effectiveness factor precipitating improvement identification division realized need cohesive system link local state federal law enforcement agency subsequently division personnel began examine operation identify area needed upgraded first implemented technological development pioneered identification division stateoftheart however intervening year industry made great stride toward producing equipment even responsive specialized need law enforcement community unfortunately division able obtain latest technological innovation therefore acquisition new hardware improved capability emerged major factor division strategic planning addition enacted legislation also influenced division longrange planning effort pursuant antidrug abuse act attorney general mandated fbi ensure data automated system complete accurate immediately available order identify felon attempt purchase firearm also airport security act recently enacted banking law required screening applicant criminal history implementation capability impacted considerably fbi already overburdened automated system methodology achieving improvement june fbi took step improve essential identification service user enlisting assistance ncic advisory policy board apb review identification division strategy plan automation make recommendation together identification division identification service subcommittee ncic apb produced conceptual road map  revitalization  division essentially plan reflects partnership federal state local law enforcement ensure identification division position meet increasing need user st century focus development implementation complete integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis basis new national concept online image transmission network interface law enforcement agency nationwide besides updating process technology greatest benefit would accrued relocating division primarily would possible install new technology identification division current facility fbi headquarters simultaneously maintaining current operation therefore total plan improvement become one revitalization relocation end fbi conducted relocation study led selection site clarksburg west virginia location new facility house iafis equipment operation design planned multilevel building allows entire division housed within one location importantly however provide required expandability flexibility accommodate new iafis iafis integration new technology capability envisioned future system identification division iafis developed using main premise electronic  paperless  submission fingerprint card related document basically system allows suspect fingerprinted booking station using livescan technology thereby eliminating fingerprint card document every step process fingerprint image personal data processed local afis electronically transmitted state identification bureau processing identification made data forwarded fbi identification division processed highly advanced afis allowing electronic response booking station within hour iafis developed using integrated

transmission network incorporate isr system store rolled plain impression digital form image data base replacing identification division current manual filing system isr system offer several advantage essentially problem inherent file size complexity identification division  outoffile condition large number misfiled print heavy consumption time labor manual filing refiling  eliminated addition fingerprint image transmitted remote user ncic telecommunication network eliminating paper hardware anticipated contributor submitting data electronically beginning itn operation therefore hardcopy processing still required support requirement paper card document converted upon receipt electronic format identical electronic submission conversion process use new technology specifically fingerprint card document scanner intelligent character recognition icr system provide electronic imaging capability itn icr system convert text computer processable character direct entry data base thereby reducing amount manual data entry resulting increase productivity decrease turnaround time contributor part three subsystem fingerprint card scanner document scanner icr system constitute hardware solution final step eliminating paper fingerprint processing use provide moreefficient identification criminal recordkeeping service law enforcement community providing communication among afiss addition new hardware image transmission network use standard provide common interface afiss standard developed american national standard institute standard conjunction national institute standard technology afis livescan user equipment vendor several benefit realized use standard first acceptable standard fulfilling information requirement current system support direct online submission fingerprint image identification data also specify image compression algorithm storage transmission reduce cost agency finally establish universal mean communication among afiss allowing enormous gain productivity advanced afis minutiaebased afis include print system searching incoming fingerprint request well latent fingerprint subsystem objective accelerate processing print search
