management              going front never really done job transfer section cosysop except emergency situation time board would nt available disk space posting would wander transfer delete old file k large something people could post two best cosysops know transfer section management particularly well perseus trigger trigger job entail basically checking new uploads keeping file proper directory ie keeping game game section business spreadsheet section checking new uploads entail making sure thing newer software making sure lastest pd stuff uploaded lastest version making sure virii present running mcaffee stuff uploads making sure proper zip format whatever local standard compression zip arc arj pak ect  locally use zip though love arj around seems accepted standard use paragon tgwn zip compression also rule keeping thing virus free da virus detected try inform everybody program question uploaded weather intentional also like available software le year old lastest version pd program question jim throughly antipirate software tolerate pirate file uploaded u also keeping file proper transfer directory important well keeping giffs giff directory keeping business software business directory important order give user best public domain downloads think could say manageing transfer section isnt difficult time consumeing due cosysop question upload download lot also like think paragon better serving downloading sysops due wwiv source distribution site jim tell right  sysops verifyed account paragon purpose paragon number  second plug board hehehehe online chain management             mean dude charge game section mainly online chain management sound better cosysop charge chain make sure user game leech make sure game secondary reason people calling mean cosysop go log

file slower wwiv run besides normally get several user call never call back real sense keeping person around contributing board resident modder          heavily modded board usually sysop mod board lot board though sysops ca nt program really since want modded board would ask bbser know good c programmer mod board type people know program c local techie expert normally make good mod well good mod something function board simplifys sometime add something wwiv normally also help make board slightly different look feel wwiv board nt get wrong  see little wrong stock wwiv minor thing might add though reason mod worst mod got random title mod serf purpose opinion humorous first time see seeing  random title affect wear good mod would mod allow know sub reading reading post good mod might sysop avialiable chat status see sometimes mod purpose nt sake another mod little everything            think cosysops really combine everything plus little talk sysop lot board related thing read
