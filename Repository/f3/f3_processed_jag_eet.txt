introduction jaguar bit riscbased system offering realtime shaded surface texture mapping system able tap growing network cable telephone video service take videogames graphic realm province midrange workstation yet departure system built ibm corp jaguar billed interactive multimedia system based ataridesigned proprietary bit risc processor proprietary digital signal processor cartridgebased system feature bit true color graphic shaded polygon realtime texture mapping atari claim jaguar offer four time processing power current bit videogames form sega nintendo belief even powerful coming bit arm cpu based machine co  spaceship go around moon person walking street turn next corner every object every detail scene reproduced shaded image texture truly amazing stuff  said atari president sam tramiel dense asics system graphic performance compared company engine midrange unix workstation like engine jaguar based advanced dense digital asics jaguar core consists two chip set one holding  bit risc processor containing dsp hardware  partitioning two chip set ambiguous  said richard miller vice president research development atari two share function two set apparently pack whole range component including controller video processor encoders leaving outside core  small amount ttls dram  said miller designed atari facility england said tramiel bit risc processor capable processing video data high rate handling various video effect well full motion video compression miller claimed lot bandwidth atari would disclose core asics gate count data bandwidth miller pointed atari engineer concentrate design effort bus bandwidth  graphic eats lot bus bandwidth available today bit processor powerpc enough want  said  designed right level expensive bit processor  meet cost goal atari push asic technology limit chip set manufactured  one top four silicon vendor world  using  smallest geometry  available said miller believed jaguar atari become one early customer major japanese micron asic process company would confirm clearly manufacturing volume essential jaguar plan company intends introduce addon pc card featuring company proprietary bit risc processor said tramiel  could also help minimize cost chip set  said atari also considering licensing chip set silicon vendor determined detail yet said tramiel future hold integration working ultimate system chip next step atari engineering team shrink currently set rather large custom chip reducing whole system  one processor one dram one rom one custom chip  said miller company looking synchronous dram rambus dram future use  waiting see standard issue get settled first  noted miller technological wish list  first  said  love micron process technology soon possible custom ic second like see form synchronous dram appear standard commodity dram naturally high bus bandwidth produce higher video performance existing improvement faster bus interface far disappointing u lastly love play atari jaguar system x foot display waiting low cost low power largescreensize display using probably active matrix fedtype technology  long run jaguar designed cartridge based game machine use bit expansion port connect cable telephone network digital signal processing port modem usage connection digital audio peripheral io structure reflects time warner percent stake atari  course product development frequent discussion time warner set direction machine cable telephone connection  said leonard tramiel vice president operating system company designed built bit prototype home entertainment machine two year ago said sam tramiel scrapped plan favor grand attempt leapfrog  bit system coming onto market atari engineer stated look enabling technology  risc processor dsps fulfilled requirement especially cost  said miller atari design team even develop hdl simulation tool said  people tend forget unlike business user consumer much higher expectation video quality speed cost  miller said  order match demand really push technological envelope driving chip count designing system highly manufacturable depending smallest geometry process technology  ibm oem atari also push envelope another way turning back traditional east asian manufacturing site calling ibm build jaguar ibm working month contract worth million responsible component sourcing quality testing console assembly packaging distribution build system charlotte nc facility motherboard come ibmapproved manufacturer said herbert watkins director application solution manufacturing ibm charlotte ibm producing atari jaguar system make first time major oem highly costcompetitive mass consumer electronics product watkins noted  manufacture one sophisticated game machine world needed someone understood highvolume fast digital machine  said miller  ibm natural choice  according ibm prototype atari jaguar system come july rampup model august mass production version september system available first limited basis fall
