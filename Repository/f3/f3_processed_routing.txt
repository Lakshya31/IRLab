fidonet route file explained part  many face fidonet ben baker fido  aspect fidonet universally mi understood routing intent foru part series clear fog justification net routing discussed many time discussed given routing good done meaning various statement go route file indeed meaning route file let first take look  network  reality  network  fidonet different thing viewed different fido formal definition fidonet node list serf adaquate view  network  independent fidos member net consider hypothetical node fido  independent member  region   network  couple hundred independent node sends message directly another couple hundred access defined  host  receives message addressed node fido  orphan  intention forwarding someone else mail pay phone bill sends message  fido know node list another independent sends message direct sends message  fido know node list member net sends  fido  executes schedule national mail window use route file another hypothetical node fido  member  inbound  net since sysop used  command properly fido know member net treat member net though independent node sends message  fido send direct  message headed side net handled   fido  executes two schedule national window followed immediatly b sits quietly wait  send mail received use route file everyone else view  network  complicated fido discover node list southern california hub local node new york megalopolis maybe host modest network memphis  network  look different sysops function route file modify fido view  network  conform fido executing mail event fido call offer mail packet fido graciously receive packet end mail event unpack message action nothing whatever route file reread last paragraph two three time sink important misunderstood point route file control way receive mail route file control way send mail paying phone bill furthermore say routeb absolutely nothing fido behaves schedule c come back point later ever since first began routing fidonet message place final destination route file used three basic command mold fido view fidonet correspond view part look schedule routeto acceptfrom see influence fido part examine bevy new routing command available fido v see made automatic distribution last possible listgen v capable generating route file auto matically part discus routectl statement map route file command stay next week maybe burn fog find bright sky calm sea clear sailing nt throw away newsletter youll want refer back time time                               fidonet route file explained part  beginning ben baker fido  time first began  routing  message fido used  route file  tell message send three basic route file command schedule aka sendto routeto acceptfrom week look command depth going farther need define couple term  target  node fido connect directly send message  addressee  ultimate destination node message important distinction routing addressee target particular message often different node  packet  collection message sent single target though perhaps several addressee beginning schedule fido build packet permitted send schedule let take look three basic command may appear route file see modify fido behavior schedule tag target list sendto target list command equivalent tell fido  schedule may build packet target target list include message different addressee may routed target consider outgoing message sent one target  unless acceptfrom statement see message originating fido qualify go packet target list empty schedule fido build packet doesnt build packet send mail even polled see next week routeto target addressee list command override node list implied routing affecting node tell fido  target target list outgoing message node addressee list put target packet  target target list blew almost quite  operation  packet built node addressee list even target list nt route message target thats target list schedule way bug earlier version fido pre vented message target sent unless also addressee list nt know corrected still good general practice put target addressee list acceptfrom originating list normally fido sends mail originating board receive message originating addressed b without statement fido attempt send along b instead mark  orphan  give indication problem otherwise ignore statement route file tell fido  build packet find message node originating list treat originated word forward message node originating list get packet schedule target list  actually suggested verb action regretted ever since misnomer better verb might  forwardfor  hindsight always  really mean  accept forwarding message guy  designed prevent paying someone else phone cost without prior arrangement put statement remember two important point mentioned route file affect send mail receive particular route file affect schedule matching tag consider fido  hypothetical bi directional host executes three schedule night schedule b national window collect outgoing mail local schedule c sends mail local  network  receives mail local schedule national window distributes mail received local routeb need neither target list accept statement indeed nt really need routeb file nt sending mail schedule b routec national net excluding  local target list also  acceptfrom local  let say  received message  last night nt delivered  message still wo nt  orphaned   nt acceptfrom list  nt target list message wont even considered schedule routed node net target list  acceptfrom  statement fore going message processed correctly forwarded  let say  try forward message jakarta   refuse delivery offending message sits mail area schedule b ignores outgoing mail nt target list schedule c jakarta target list  originating list message orphaned schedule  originating list jakarta target list message ignored make mistake jakarta target list schedule message would sent even though marked orphan schedule c provided course connection could made jakarta happened mail schedule time mean message orphaned error routing file routing file corrected message still sent orphan flag dead end similar kind bug existed may still dont know acceptfrom routeto route file contains acceptfrom statement make sure node originating list first time used statement forwarded lot message  orphaned  message well routing achieved remember statement control outgoing mail receive mail even nt route file final point routing message say file attached even file nt exist bet routing suspended message sent direct originator addressee fido several builtin safeguard prevent forwarding someone else file forwarding file someone else matter next week take close look goody tj provided version see making automatic node list distribution long last reality                               fidonet route file explained part  keep old ring new ben baker fido  last week looked basic routing statement u since version let look added version please refer back last week definition con tinue use defined recvonly tell fido  go ahead build packet target schedule command target list dont attempt call anybody target happen call reason try give packet get away  must target list statement mean anything intended normally  receive  schedule like  collection schedule see last week instead prevents originating call schedule trying send mail route file control send mail receive really trying send mail guy nickel see cooperate venture statement might used local collection schedule large busy net collision avoided one node outbound host placing call poll see local outgoing traffic hold hold target list  ok fido build packet target target list nt attempt actually call target hold target list  limited  recvonly  command packet target hold target list sent normally nt picked packet hold target list  picked  hidden gimmick bear exploration ken kaplan fido  aka  original source national nodelist distribution system regional coordinator call fido week pick copy latest nodelist route file national window contains statement  hold regional coordinator list  fido attempt send packet targetted regional coordinator mean ca nt send  normal  message coordinator member net  normal  message including addressed coordinator wind packet targetted  outbound host since  hold target list packet sent message go hold applies target packet addressee message ken sends message coordinator nodelist file attached fido build packet targetted instead  mean ken ca nt send coordinator file without waiting pick well yes hold statement ca nt say send fidoibmexe  see pickup   use another gimmick coordinator dual identity set command fido certainly send file  fido smart smart notice   happen phone number send packet  hold one  token packet still present  call pick nodelist targetted  new fido targetted  ca nt cake eat pickup pickup target list whenever fido call fido reason fido look see packet targetted fido try deliver avoid making phone call pay without statement next one route file fido simply hang leaving phone call make order deliver packet statement say fido  happen call target pickup target list hang around see mail  twoedged sword speed mail exchange fido place call pay work best within local net call toll free anyway fact wo nt work larger net supported distinct inbound outbound host specifying  pickup   national window schedule would get message originating   actually file attached mail might packet addressed  outbound host called even worse let say tom jennings sending file  want pick mail st louis san francisco host net perfectly legitimate right wrong primary identity command   may packet  wo nt packet  command deal packettarget level hold command furthermore deal real identity alternate identity said useful within local net probably applied poll poll target list tell fido  even nt mail target poll target list generate empty packet addressed excuse call call pick anything   poll poll target list  implies  pickup poll target list  need specified statement outbound host might use poll local hub outgoing traffic prior national mail time together next statement method efficient regional coordinator run special schedule saturday morning national mail window route file identical normal national schedule route file except contains statement  poll   get nodelist subsequent redis tribution see poll lot us pickup sendonly one mainly outbound host say  im expecting mail schedule nt wait normal one two minute incomming call making outgoing call soon finish one dial another packet sent  said efficient problem need aware fido make maximum attempt without connect send packet particular target one packet addressed busy target fido would normally take hour use attempt sendonly mode attempt call minute courier running  x  response code mode make attempt minute courier nt waste lot time  fastdial busydetect  mode outbound host want try sendonly national window risk using call attempt target busiest he quieted could get given suggest break national time two schedule use sendonly last minute national window hand polling local hub different matter recvonly mode expect every call connect first try call attempt limit nt apply situation send command used shorten time needed poll everyone noroute addressee list command tell fido  send message addressed node anywhere addressed node treat though file attached whether  let say thing like fido  illinois might sendto  outbound host missouri routeto  send everything accross river noroute  except illinois traffic way achieve end list routeto command odd node whose message routed  list change every week good handle command used route tag control fido sends file schedule tag sometimes command require long list node number change week week node list change listgen generate route file automatically let specify long list symbolically term net area code etc next week last part series see statement listgen routectl file correspond command route tag                               fidonet route file explained part  listgen routectl ben baker fido  listgen version automatically generate route file desire advantage listgen driven control file routectl specify statement necessary symbolic parameter define term net area code etc properly designed routectl need change routing need change listgen continue create correct route file week week nodelist change begin like quick review route file command effect schedule tag list sendto list determines node may packet build send mail routeto target list directs message par ticular addressee sent packet another node acceptfrom list specifies oritinators message may sent recvonly state packet may sent picked hold list state packet part icular node may sent picked pickup list state ok receive mail particular node originate call send packet poll list directs packet empty necessary generated sent particular node order pick mail sendonly state call may made rapidfire send many packet possible note definition includes verb send sent deliberately emphasize command control aspect sending mail listgen adaquately documented intend redocument would like show routectl command map route tag command covered schedule tag target list listgen encounter command routectl two thing first close route file may working creates new route tag file new tag generates schedule statement specification one new route tag expanding symbolic parameter list node nodelist word begin new route file would expect defining target list accept list phrase encountered generates acceptfrom statement addressee list via target via clause present statement generates  routeto target addressee list  successive phrase without via clause accumulate make larger addressee list via clause found entire list routed target entirely happy  feature  way work via clause ever found phrase generates output serve documentation routectl file saying  expect sending mail node schedule  route file command discussed map oneforone format routectl route tag big advantage using listgen able use simple symbol translate long list node illustrate net span two area code missouri illinois minimize number toll call placed accross mississippi serve  metro east  hub concentrate illinois traffic following statement among others routectl file define metroeast net except area area define outbound  define world except metroeast metroeast world via outbound node may come go net across country statement need change listgen interprets week week build right route file every time several month outbound host change making necessary change routectl look say  earth trying  pretty obvious wrap two important exception thing said first schedule special target list always entire nodelist matter routea say reason routing defined node list recommend use schedule schedule fido exactly route tag tell nothing second routebbs special route file affect schedule route tag file reason recommend forget ever heard routebbs cause problem ever solve routing get pretty complex ask em southern california nt need complicated know objective schedule point view fido need meet objective fact pretty easy remember two point hammering since began route file control way send message way receive every command discussed control aspect sending message particular route file affect schedule matching tag say routeb bearing whatever schedule c schedule must separately spelled
