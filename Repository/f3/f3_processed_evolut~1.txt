laser relatively light mass shortrange power hungry mortar minimum range require heavy ammunition also long maximum range require line sight fire autocannon inflict moderate damage moderate range require large amount moderately heavy ammunition miniguns lighter smaller shortrange version autocannon missile varying range warhead shot point defense heavy particle beam weapon highly effective narrowly focused range aside mortar missile particle beam weapon improve range shortens nonoffensive weapon system stealth missile defense hardpoints stealth expensive allows unit approach others

greatly used common hardpoint load anti aircraft missile play balance rock paper scissors selection weapon determines much unit unit longrange weapon usually require heavy ammunition great weight mean limited mobility limited mobility implies inability escape unit high mobility shortrange weapon axiomatic shortrange weapon require high mobility therefore shortrange weapon must light effective tradeoff required play balance among wide diversity system mortar unit example popular team people actually wanted play successful play unit must maneuver effectively fire weapon evade enemy fire distribute enemy fire across multiple armor facing team mate present unit coordinate fire among team member combine fire single enemy unit unit take damage flee repaired richness detail bot family

written aero unit success auto unit ground removed demand auto equivalent aero original algorithm original algorithm auto quite simple closest enemy unit selected target unit ignored auto turned face enemy attempted close see figure maneuver complete unit attempted fire weapon fire target closest enemy within arc weapon fire unit would flee damaged unit would jump unless blocked water building steep slope spreading damage many failure original algorithm foremost among propensity unit lose center forward armor take severe internal damage left right forward armor facing pristine solution problem unit shorten amount moved save sufficient mobility rotate motion see figure rotation would bring strongest forward armor face closest enemy unit relative bearing integer value forward armor parameter enabled change typically tripled survival unit especially allowed unit shortrange weapon close effective range algorithm became known basic closure code self assessment modified algorithm still major problem long closure unit would loose three forward armor facing continue closing take fatal internals fix involved self assessment unit started maneuver would evaluate state forward armor internal system ammunition three forward armor facing minimum half internal system destroyed ammunition gone unit would declare unfit battle flee would turn strongest rear armor toward closest enemy move far away possible slightly modified version basic closure code unit jump pack available would jump far away possible would choose shoot power based weapon save energy mobility parameter change simple integer number armor system ammunition count change increased long term survivability auto unit greatly destroying unit often required long chase rolling terrain enemy unit would simply disappear seriously damaged battle range point auto unit interesting threatening maneuver highly predictable point blank range unit would close zero range stop since motion bot simultaneous human player would simply move forward turn around finding near zero range facing back auto unit fatal internals auto unit often soon followed longrange unit mortar specific range unit particle beam weapon continuo closure especially counterproductive mortar unit minimum range requirement care little range otherwise laser family closure improves damage closure also give advantage lightest shortest ranged laser fix establish battle range known brg weapon type parameter used brg range brg number tuned play many weapon benefit close range brg picked balance survivability ability inflict damage longrange unit would prefer stay range denying shortrange unit fire unit found close would back much could yet backing cost twice much forward motion brg helped keep longrange support unit trouble helped unit survive combat shortrange unit shortrange unit still predictable easy human player destroy brg evolutionary step set stage major milestone auto evolution first major milestone change new maneuver code problem maneuver code predictability new maneuver code dealt answer two question  unit go   unit want go  first question answered computing mobility unit based power mass unit get roughly point within circle centered unit radius equal mobility unit computing radius mobility circle sufficient mobility deducted radius provide turn second question answered brg target move effective place place circle centered target radius brg see figure two circle intersect existing basic closure code used circle intersect three possibility first possibility shown figure dangerous case target best case attacker situation often seen high mobility unit carrying short ranged weapon attack unit pick random point brg circle move turn face target target evade must either move far enough get range must move behind random point brg circle attacker appear neither evasion easy first requires good mobility second requires good luck target move far enough away deny weapon fire attacker power available move next turn second possibility shown figure good case attacker situation often seen medium high mobility unit carrying mediumrange weapon attack unit randomly pick one two intersection point move turn face target target mobility attacker able maneuver attacker figure move toward figure attacker becomes nearly impossible evade third case shown figure mobility circle inside brg circle mean attacker close usually case low mobility unit carrying longrange weapon closer desired enemy unit unit determines would get farther away backing turning away moving forward turning face target chooses way take farthest away executes maneuver brg computed mobility parameter change combined effective algorithm effect first milestone change dramatic attacking unit much effective fleeing unit unaffected human player could longer destroy auto unit without pause close combat maneuver became dicey novice player le chance winning oneonone duel single combat auto unit played solid uninspired game never made stupid error initial team play communication team play auto still lacked great deal fought mob rather team unit could see target would pick random patrol point map head toward scattering behavior good finding hidden enemy unit poor fighting enemy team one unit team engaged rest team would ignore combat unless could see target evolution continued auto unit learned basic communication skill unit could see target would ask team targeting information unit aero auto bot team would reply map coordinate target could see coordinate could used next turn plot motion unit require line ofsight fire mortar would fire blindly map coordinate given effect change twofold allowed high mobility unit carrying shortranged weapon close upon enemy unit could see meant enemy unit spotted unoccupied auto would head toward even rolling terrain second effect provided mortar team something productive communicating map coordinate proved effective change enemy unit meant expect mortar fire whenever spotted member auto team particularly nasty combination stalked unseen stealth unit broadcasting coordinate mortar teammate change tended keep mob auto together still fought mob second major milestone change improved team play targeting still based closest enemy could fired team play lone unit could distract part team auto play pied piper rest piper team destroyed part auto team piper might survive destroyed multiple enemy unit would destroyed tipping battle auto second milestone change increased team play team play based concept team target enemy unit appeared hurt would designated team target designation based volume fire enemy absorbed team target would always preferred target motion control team target minimum maximum effective range weapon fired would preferred target fire well result often devastating occasionally quite strange devastating part stemmed fact single unit often already damaged could take mortar longrange missile autocannon much shortrange laser fire entire team could inflict strange part would happen auto unit would move directly past ignore closer target order help destroy team target team target viable target unit would fire usually closest target mishap team play fatal team expert well achieve kill ratio  favor expert novice team required two five time numerical superiority win parameter used developed earlier stage evolution attack jump evolution continued detail refined solve minor problem one problem auto would use jump pack flee cross water meant would often unused jump pack reload time new jump pack would available fix simple unit still carrying jump pack near reload time would free jump increase mobility parameter used unit turn counter already existed change made dangerous rely prediction mobility auto unit fast moving unit moving four range per turn would suddenly jump eight move four total twelve range motion four expected dealing aeros final change involved dealing aeros bot auto usually move one four range per turn aeros need move least ten retain airspeed speed twenty fifty normal normal altitude aeros typically run eight twenty range altitude first problem aeros created auto would attempt set motion based aero target since motion algorithm optimized nonmoving target using aero set motion ineffective unit short brg ineffective unit long brg aero close since bearing aero would change dramatically even perfect predictive algorithm available unit long brg sufficient range hurt aeros altitude important change range based unit brg higher would prefer visible enemy aero target fire motion unit lower brg would ignore aeros plotting motion aero somehow acceptable range would preferred fire target reload time auto remembered seen aeros since last reload changed hardpoint weapon mix prefer anti aircraft missile change decreased survivability aeros greatly aero target preferred even team target often deadly result muchmaligned mortar unit provided greatly needed flak
