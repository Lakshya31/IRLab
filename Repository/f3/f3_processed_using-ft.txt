host anywhere world many site set software library available network user via anonymous ftp explained later ftp            since ftp performs actual login host remote host browse remote host file directory used telnet set host however ftp also allows special type login called anonymous ftp case user need account system instead log communal account userid  anonymous  case proper  nettiquette

move around remote system                      depends bit type machine remote host vast majority system support ftp simply type  cd  directory name move   named directory  cd   two period move back   one level directory hierarchy also immediately zoom ftp login level directory started connecting remote host typing cd navigation command differ vms system must type cd directory move cd  move include bracket otherwise directory navigation command pretty much universal kind file transfer ftp                        ftp several command may need use initiating actual transfer depending type file involved two basic command binary image ascii default mode ftp transfer ascii work fine text file ruin executables image file successfully transfer binary must type command  binary   bin   image  prompt initiating transfer similarly textonly file become  garbage  transferred binary mode want transfer text transfering binary make sure type  ascii  first see table end document listing file type require ftp transfer mode follow progress ftp transfer                       yes sort  type command  hash  initiating transfer system print series pound sign onscreen transfer run copy file remote host onto                            receive get file remote host use get command proper syntax  get remotefilename targetfilename  target file name refers name want file local computer computer file moving target file name optional system default original file name nt indicate target file name handy way transferring renaming file one step note unix system use multiple period filename eg  blahtarz  vms make sure remote file name compatible host operating system example copy file applsithqx remote host renaming applhqx transit example ftp get applsithqx applhqx beginning ascii transfer  transfer complete byte transmitted second byte look file without transferring first                          ftp allows read content text file  fly  without actually placing copy file system making screen destination although command unix vms system similar difference vms system simply type get filename tt content text file scroll across screen note ready hit control  hold screen  entire file scroll without stopping page break unix system simply type get filename devtty content text file scroll across screen want display stop scrolling time screen fill use command get filename version unix use pg instead able read text one screen time move file onto remote host                    put command work like get command without tt trick complete danger different operating system different file naming convention note majority anonymous ftp site allow put file onto disk without prior permission usually specific directory contact adminstrator specific anonymous ftp archive information site policy hey  get outta                 exit ftp log remote system enter command  bye   exit   quit  prompt different system may react one command result end looking  ftp  prompt simply enter command second time
