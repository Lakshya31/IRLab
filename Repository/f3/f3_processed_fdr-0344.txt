following introductory book chapter one best introductory book anarchism unfortunately print excerpted reinventing anarchy anarchist thinking day edited howard j carol ehrlich others published routledge kegan paul question answer anarchism editor would anarchist revolution come social anarchist revolution process process leading total deflation state authority process entail self collective education building alternative institution mechanism survival training model new society continuing part process repeated symbolic protest direct assault ruling class institution people regard anarchist alternative preferable status quo state power begin deflated state longer maintain confidence substantial segment population agent rely increasingly mobilization police military course increase force multiple possible outcome ranging total repression left leftward mobilization population regard increased use force illegitimate scenario rule guerrilla warfare armed struggle united state example mammoth police apparatus extensive file surveillance radical  underground emergency operating center rulingclass military retreat idea primarily military revolution atavistic marxist fantasy go next act revolutionary drama remains written drawing battle plan today seems pointless overthrow state building anarchist society overwhelming majoritarian act otherwise say  per cent population identify anarchist guess would range contingency available could possibly anticipate today make anarchist revolution everyone every day daily life anarchist society prevent development informal elite new bureaucracy reconcentration power nothing integral nature human social organization make hierarchy centralization elitism inescapable organizational form persist part serve interest top persist learned accept role leadership followership come define hierarchy necessary centralization efficient say learned ideological justification elite organizational form quite well could dismiss question pointing social motivation power elite elitism bureaucracy would exist anarchist society question dismissed however talk building anarchist society shell another context inevitably struggling lifedenying value socialization hierarchy dominance submission repression power fact everyday life revolution process even eradication coercive institution automatically create liberatory society create society building new institution changing character social relationship changing throughout process changing distribution power society constant building new form organization continual critical evaluation success failure prevent old idea old form organization reemerging begin revolutionary project make revolution decision made consensus majority group make decision consensus majority rule unacceptable people think everyone run life decisionmaking majority rule mean minority voluntarily give control policy affect operate consensus group discus issue resolved satisfaction everyone nt mean one way thing people must accept many way coexist also must realize multiple policy issue people free choose policy want principle consensus effective membership community voluntary membership entail agreement basic goal value working consensual decision many advantage way prevent permanent minority developing take consideration strength feeling efficient group action people genuinely involved achieving consensus therefore likely act decision one thing people difficulty understanding group consensus take account strength feeling difference perspective people involved social anarchist meeting process decisionmaking important outcome course people learn recognize want express desire constructive way know want false consensus develops people trying go along group make trouble decision reached way people remain unhappy outcome participation may drop low level may ultimately feel leave group people motivated participate decision affect nt want participate kind society live pseudoquestion people managed rarely asked participate unmotivated citizen capitalistsocialist state sized situation correctly concluded nonparticipation realistic choice anarchist community everyone would genuine control life would assume nonparticipant would existed would ask idle question wished survive anarchist community would solve problem failed community would road back social inequality would longer anarchist two reason person might participate making decision first would lack time person busy either voluntarily taken much work others shirking neither case community functioning genuine social anarchist principle second reason quite different nonparticipation would due working much misplaced sense priority failure see linkage personal autonomy community functioning people may feel community decisionmaking beneath star mentality need effectively challenged every time occurs others may genuinely believe community affords everything need physical psychological wellbeing perfectly happy letting others make decision still others may feel alienated lack confidence ability make competent decision people handicapped old idea well suited stratified society run life everyone severely damaging anarchist community people think way need loving support others feeling essential part community gentle firm pressure participate may take time done community become large operate direct participation everyone system representation ever justified really know maximum optimum size community would still allow effective participation numerous example community large  people people actively participated selfgovernment example spanish revolution selfgoverned village spain formed federation coordinate decision affecting denmark people occupied army camp set viable functioning community lasted year able defend nonviolently attack government example everyone made decision goal community achieve people actually particular task able work way decentralized society composed many community line communication go multiple direction twoway television technological improvement make direct democracy possible larger group probably still time representative necessary selection procedure representative would doubt vary sometimes representative could drawn lot time basis taskspecific skill ability system representation however must meet certain criterion representative must come group people represent must accountable group make accountable representative assigned brief period time specific task anarchist society nobody could make career politics role representative could rotated among member community important decision would made group whole representative would communicate decision group larger group representative must also subject immediate recall decision function best one community one group made group time depending upon circumstance every reason believe people effectively participate managing life still expert specialization expert trained know competent expert nonhierarchical society difference skill knowledge continue exist difference compatible free egalitarian society people may also want develop ability way compatible social anarchism much work done specialist learned relatively short time could done nearly everyone one problem specialist society restrain number people trained obviously work surgery architecture requires high degree skill acquired lengthy training one want operated someone two week training people would feel comfortable fivestory building assembled without blueprint real problem becomes training specialist accountable people serve want cooperation specialist client solidarity among specialist ensure could position privilege specialist must committed sharing knowledge everyone decentralized small society judging competence someone whose labor highly visible carpenter difficult somewhat complex case say judging competence surgeon one possibility people work surgeon along community judge quality work expertise nonhierarchy coexist specialization convey special privilege people expert monopolize control resource information people committed cooperative collective work rather destructive competition dirty work anarchist community people would nt categorize work dirty clean whitecollar bluecollar way thinking exist classstratified society one teach member maintenance task undignified demeaning avoided possible anarchist socially useful work dignity everyone would cooperate sustain community mutually agreedupon level health comfort beauty refuse collect garbage clean street building trim grass provide clean water supply would acting irresponsible fashion continued refuse would asked leave seem coercive successfully selfgoverned community must comprised people voluntarily live work together agree necessary task selfdiscipline carry share task le refuse coercing others implicitly saying time spent important thing menial task anarchist community one anyone else one important anyone else think destroy equality freedom one thing make dirty work onerous people work fulltime maintenance task would seem totally awful rotated person knew would short period time short work period garbage truck cleaning public bathroom fertilizing field would seem well fun course anarchist nt stupid would tolerable person knew would end soon people money property others control mean production profit distributed anarchist society everyone equal right basic liberty material good consistent similar right others people would course maintain personal possession would expect matter accumulation property property right would different certainly meaning money property would quite different egalitarian nonhierarchical society hard conceive serious alternative market economy however unlike capitalist market place anarchist economy would based maximization control profit therefore would need monopolize resource expand market create useless product andor consumer demand worker community control workplace would organizational form regulating productivity profit keeping need community anarchist economic theory remains written theorem derived principle social justice principle claim maximum value freedom equality people nt anarchist ignoring complexity urban life nt rejecting technology industrial development nt really want go back simpler society anarchist ignore complexity modern urbanindustrial society wrong return simpler society fantasy escapist person seriously committed building new society underlying issue u social anarchist determination optimum size urban settlement equation optimum size would doubtless balance factor selfsufficiency self governance minimizing damage ecosystem related technological problem must taken seriously anarchist satisfy energy requirement technology minimal environmental damage develop technology comprehended people develop technology genuine substitute human labor answer question yes technology knowledge already issue implementation result implementing technological change building selfgoverning relatively selfsufficient community would probably bring substantial difference urban settlement suspect difference would yield even complex urban arrangement suspect would result genuinely humane city anarchist society meet threat foreign invasion paradoxically successfully meet threat armed force likely move away anarchist principle war always seems turn relatively free open society repressive one war irrational foster fear hopelessness gentle brings aggression hatred brutality truculent destroys balance people nature shrink sense community one immediately endangered group condition starvation deprivation pit neighbor neighbor fight survival besieged anarchist community successfully resist foreign invasion immediately work reestablish interrelationship trust mutual aid equality freedom probably damaged war health state fatal disease anarchist community war came however would society organize defend let u assume anarchist federation north america invaded troop chinese swedish saudi arabian brazilian government would happen would state apparatus seize instead invader would conquer network small community one one would single army defeat entire armed population people would challenge invasion resistance strike psychological warfare noncooperation well guerrilla tactic larger armed action circumstance unlikely invader would conquer federation crime much defined crime would longer exist communalization property ethic mutual aid would reduce necessity motivation property crime crime people seem complex reject idea rooted original sin human nature degree crime stem societally based disorder personality anticipate incidence well actual form would radically altered social anarchist society crime would defined solely act harmful liberty others would crime different people would crime harm someone hostile act community could prevented inculcating respect dignity person anarchist value would reinforced strongest human bond affection selfrespect remaining crime would administered mass lawyer police judge criminal would tossed prison kropotkin labeled university crime common law regularly rotated jury could decide whether particular act crime could criticize censure ostracize even banish criminal however case anticipate criminal would placed care guidance member community shall public health issue handled public health issue would handled like issue mean decision inoculation health issue would made local level people would affected decision would result different type health care health care worker would member community worked function would provide daytoday care advice people remain healthy people would chance talk frequently worker would know really concerned health making money gaining status community threatened epidemic deadly flu vaccine developed people community would able get together discus risk benefit inoculation group decided inoculation would benefit community would try persuade everyone inoculated people protected le likelihood would epidemic clear case people danger health entire community would asked make choice vaccinated remaining community leaving find another group compatible time state take care sick elderly protects individual coercion example child brutalized parent black attacked white state disappears take function people look world way believe two possibility either state regulation orderly society stateless chaos life nasty brutish short fact even state function benevolent protective manner capricious sometimes help helpless time nt sometimes social welfare worker remove child vicious environment time child left home perhaps brutalized even killed sometimes state protects civil right oppressed minority time ignores right even join persecution count state anything protect u major task agent state protect distribution power social justice secondary concern fact count freely associated community mean helping function performed group always done without state voluntary association however anarchist community need service le frequent example longer systematic poisoning environment disease caused pollution pesticide poisoning asbestosis minimata disease happen longer extreme wealth poverty disease caused lack adequate food shelter medical care exist child adult freely choose whether live together much violence loved one disappear racism systematically attacked majority ethnic group wo nt harass minority course still need mutual aid protection provided community member would anarchist society le likely sexist racist anarchist usually talk illegitimacy authority basing argument premise person power another logical extension argument attack power relationship men dominate woman racial ethnic group dominate others thus anarchism creates precondition abolishing sexism racism anarchism philosophically opposed manifestation racism sexism equally important philosophical commitment fact anarchism would economic basis support racist sexist idea practice work income would divided equitably would need subordinate class people dirty work work low pay support dominant class sexism racism would automatically disappear process building anarchist society conscious effort would made change old behavior attitude anarchist think sex monogamy family anarchist believe live daily life important political statement people industrialized society spend significant portion life may last bulwark capitalism state socialism monogamous nuclear family family serf primary agent reproducing dominant value society socialization child social control member within family pathology larger society reproduced privatized social relation escapism patriarchal dominance economic dependency capitalist society consumerism treatment people property anarchist society social relation based trust mutual aid friendship love may occur context family people choose live family setting certainly indeed condition may easily achieved outside family monogamous relation anarchist society clearly people option choose want live long want live relationship course include option monogamy however without system based patriarchy economic insecurity religious state authority doubt monogamy would anything anachronism people elect live monogamously presumably would seen choice made person today course monogamy considered far important woman men called double standard place society free equal woman men family nuclear family universal social system rearing young care elderly companionate relation think whole new form communal collective living arrangement grow replace traditional family system sex course mean kind sexual behavior would condoned imagine truly anarchist society condoning rape sexual exploitation child sex inflicts pain humiliation involves dominance submission sexual behavior form behavior social anarchism based freedom trust respect dignity others fact anarchist society sexuality would lose inegalitarian oppressive meaning coercive require education child content structure people today worry coercive character mandatory public education think concern really stem authoritarian character schooling school extension state reproduce class sex race division state built anarchist society social function school potential education would quite different even today think implication withholding basic education young child far coercive requirement educated without least minimal level literacy people would much worse already anarchist society education would course provide far education would fundamentally liberating would help people learn learn would teach much could ever acquire physical world world idea would also help learn free selfdirected education important young child neither parent able decide child nt need bakunin stated reason well child constitute anyone property belong future freedom child freedom yet real potential real freedom based upon feeling one dignity upon genuine respect someone el freedom dignity ie upon justice freedom develop child rational development mind character would anarchist education teach young intellectual physical skill help develop literate healthy competent people taught essential intellectual material would include child learn nt reading writing selfcare emotional physical farming carpentry cooking physical education child upper elementary grade would introduced literature art crosscultural material principle anarchist community organization economics however content material reflect anarchist value would senseless teach principle capitalist politics economics except perhaps horrible example acceptance stratification material advocate racist sexist inegalitarian idea content also structure anarchist education vitally important difficult develop liberatory mode thought action atmosphere intimidation regimentation boredom respect authority mean imply child devalue teacher genuine respect must based upon someone know effectively teach upon position age credential difficult create atmosphere mutual respect orderly process without imposing discipline liberatory education take place authoritarian setting else well school small child get attention stimulation need activity varied distinction work play narrowed far possible grading competition would eliminated student would learn set standard try meet child evaluate himherself negatively guilt selfdeprecation enemy autonomy healthy functioning teacher would selected basis knowledge interpersonal competence upon possession formal credential probably people would make career teaching many member community including older child would spend time school would integrated community everyone would participate direction school would education end ideally never instead prison inmate flee soon guard back turned many public school like today anarchist school would encourage people see education lifelong process child becomes adult education would increasingly become informal selfdirected activity would take place outside school people would return formal study often long wish relation child authority line nurturance authoritarian control child difficult draw perhaps anarchist society boundary line clearly sketched infant young child unquestionably dependent others survival perhaps difference nurturance authoritarianism arises child acquired skill survival accept boundary work determining skill minimally skill go beyond acquisition language absolute relative social condition people live example capitalism income work tied together prerequisite food housing medical care like survival training must last longer partly long period dependency strong tradition setting view child young adult property hence disposal family state certainly political economy one condition foster dependence authority fostering authoritarian dependence fact major mechanism social control capitalist state socialist society today easier catalog example dependence authoritarian social condition provide example social condition encourage selfmanagement autonomous behavior quintessence nurturant childrearing anarchist community would teaching child like learn learn set standard selfevaluation ever successful anarchist organization nt last longer yes fact many group organized without centralized government hierarchy privilege formal authority explicitly anarchist perhaps bestknown example spanish industrial agricultural collective functioned quite successfully several year destroyed combined force authoritarian left right anarchist organization called even member anthropological literature full description human society existed without centralized government institutionalized authority however contemporary feminist anthropologist point gut many socalled egalitarian culture sexist industrialized society also contain many group anarchist practice british anarchist colin ward say anarchist society society organizes without authority always existence like seed beneath snow example include leaderless small group developed radical feminist coop clinic learning network medium collective direct action organization clamshell alliance spontaneous grouping occur response disaster strike revolution emergency communitycontrolled daycare center neighborhood group tenant workplace organizing group anarchist course surprising number function without leadership authority provide mutual aid resist government develop better way thing nt last longer people ask question expect anarchist organization meet standard permanence anarchist value flexibility change hold nonanarchist group meet course another reason many anarchist organization last longer anarchist enemy state state manager react kindly enemy anarchist organization blocked harassed sometimes case spain recently portugal deliberately smashed circumstance tribute persistence capability many anarchist organization last long often
