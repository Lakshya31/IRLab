millionth second time drain waiting hard drive operates thousandth second floppy drive operates tenth full second wasted time obvious point logic using hard drive need organize file minimum time delay processor first outer track disk always boot record load main portion do machine following file allocation table fat discussed earlier tutorial fat maintains data cluster xt class machine byte class

floppy safekeeping hard drive periodically reorganized file unfragmented ensure speedy retrieval access data inexpensive free software program known  disk file unfragmenters  job nicely disk file

essentially  defragging  hard drive done regularaly perhaps weekly defragging substitute caching ramdisks buffer instead maintenance function done regularly yet another possible avenue improve disk performance changing disk interleave factor discus bit later tutorial way brief introduction disk interleave indicates many revolution magnetic platter required read sector data spinning track ratio

program test alters interleave factor done may yield better performance interleave adjustment software first performs test determine current interleave possible change course much performance time might gained package alter interleave file place backup truly essential file starting process interleave factor adjustment mainly derived cpu speed disk speed thus fast equipped machine likely able take advantage interleave adjustment tinkering hard drive optimum result might best divided two category disk substitution disk alteration do allows two clever way substituting ram memory disk memory first using buffer small configsys file hard drive modified contain buffer statement sample might buffer do buffer area ram memory capable holding byte mirror image disk sector allows do quickly search buffer area frequently used data instead slower disk older xt class machine specify buffer size do defaulted buffer later version do default buffer user settle buffer specify current release do nt get something nothing used full buffer available would soak k main ram memory downside using buffer necessarily better unfortunately do search buffer area ram sequentially rather logically do requires data buffer area search byte area sequence top bottom even though data need may end buffer logically optimum number buffer many used small program slow thing enough do forced go disk retrieve need rarely use data within program twice load lot different program data large number buffer wo nt help however need frequent access certain data file portion file buffer help portion fat kept within buffer area dropping buffer zero damaging effect do must always go disk read fat nt helpful either another way substituting ram memory disk memory involves using ramdisk idea create ram memory entire disk small portion disk work like magic many machine since reading track sector take place high speed ram memory rather mechanically limited speed readwrite head floppy hard drive careful three area difficulty arise first must remember take data floppy hard drive move ramdisk many people automatically within autoexecbat file may several floppy different ramdisk configuration depending task hand copying data ramdisk usually move along briskly secondly must sacrifice large area memory ramdisk longer used main program user computer extended expanded memory usually choose put ramdisk extended expanded memory area ram precious main memory lost still small ramdisk soak k ram memory one two meg ramdisks area common many user third serious problem using ramdisks volatile switch machine

temporary file well programming compiler benefit ramdisk use batch file disk intensive well small utility really sprint placed ramdisk basically program file frequently used loadedunloaded repeatedly disk normal computer operation excellent candidate ramdisk placement do contains ramdisk called using statement devicevdisksys deviceramdrivesys using msdos placed configsys file do manual detail specific stating size ramdisk giving drive letter must still copy target file ramdisk place search path path command mentioned previous tutorial ramdisk always first drive letter mentioned path command do search first optimum result yet another area investigation cache software essentially cache extension buffer idea discussed earlier twist cache searched intelligently searching algorithm within cache software rather top bottom typical do buffer search system disk cache software obtained either commercial software shareware ramdisk cache requires chunk ram memory operate extended memory expanded memory main ram memory manufacturer include cache program software package do disk cache sophisticated type ramdisk rough sense cache software allocates large area memory storage frequently used disk data data updated intelligent cache search algorithm attempt  guess  track disk might read need next cache also store frequently used disk data attempt remove le frequently used data whenever do request disk data cache software first try fill order data currently stashed cache prevents slower disk search data written program cache first disk write done prevent data loss case power failure data stashed cache case needed usually hard drive data target cache activity floppy disk could also cached cache software allows allocate size cache well drive drive cached even allow specify exact file data cached key high use data life ram memory keep tedious disk access time low general computer megabyte memory speedy processor either cache ramdisk option improve performance
