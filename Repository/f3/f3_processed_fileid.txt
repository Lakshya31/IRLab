make bb user want download file also try include hardware software requirement product may try use first line text give basic description program helpful sysops bb software limit le line character sysops limited using shorter description simply use st two line truncate rest thus basically still supply description bb software actually utilize fileiddiz feature remaining line text used elaborate program feature enhancement prior version information concerning multifile set please note older version bb software use line text advisable create fileiddiz file file truncated various line length without destroying usefulness example    program v asp program anything anybody run k memory run command line installed tsr completely menu driven version  reduces previous k memory requirement add enhanced graphical user interface also program contains window desqview support coming soon o version doitall software inc  multiple disk info          please note distribution archive requires multiple archive file create separate specific fileiddiz file archive utilized describe various content archive identify disk set example fileiddiz file disk could contain  program v asp program executable file disk  followed detailed description text fileiddiz file disk could contain  program v asp documentation file disk  followed detailed description text optionally could also create  complete  fileiddiz file first disk would fully describe program detail identify disk x remaining file set simply include program name version number asp identifier disk number ie  program v asp disk x  additional info        please nt tempted use fancy graphic ansi sequence fileiddiz file bb software allow render fileiddiz file useless also nt tempted simply copy program description file

user able read documentation file distribution archive prior downloading many bb system offer ability user actual distribution archive file described contain install utility selfextracting program archive file described userinstalled program             type distribution archive much simpler authorinstalled variety simply archive file containing file program described since type program requires user installation manually contain specific detailed information regarding installation requirement installtxt distribution archive file                actual distribution archive file merely archive file containing file described bb distribution archive standard archive format selfextracting archive many sysops allow selfextracting archive bb software allow selfextracting archive uploaded many popular archive utility available pkzip lha lharc arj etc bb system capable handling archive virtually format however aware bb system convert archive format format choice sysop following method described conversion process affect program selfextracting file contained within distribution archive file also retain default archive file extension defined archive utility example pkzip us  zip  lharc us  lzh  etc changing file extension may cause bb software delete file nt recognize format actual filename distribution archive recommended program filename limited character represent program name ie myprog could represent  program  followed numeric digit represent version number release even initial release include version number filename ie myprogzip would indicate program called  program  version  please note compuserve limit filename character limiting file  name  character easily able rename archive compuserve uploading simply removing digit version identifier make file compatible compuserve library including digit version number archive filename easy user sysop identify older version program multiple distribution archive                one time recommended final distribution archive larger k would fit single k floppy disk still leave room distribution file necessary disk vendor ie disk vendor often include gobat file various small file help customer install software limitation slowly falling wayside computer system   floppy disk drive standard program large enough require one distribution archive recommended filename limited character rather described following character name digit version number append single  letter  identify disk ie mypgmazip mypgmbzip etc uploading compuserve filename may shortened character removing version identifier ie mypgmazip mypgmbzip however compuserve recommended simply create single distibution file eliminate multipart file set program requires multiple distribution archive sure create separate fileiddiz file distribution archive also fileiddiz file contain disk number information pertaining individual archive ie disk disk etc distribution disk           recommended distribution disk simply contain zipd version product however choose supply  unarchived  file distribution disk disk vendor use important specify documentation suggested archive filename bb sysops create archived file proper authorspecified filename information contained sysoptxt vendortxt file nt supply suggested archive file name sysops forced create name thus may end thousand version product bb system world different filename please note asp hub network nearly every electronic distribution service require file submitted archived file using zip format also note many bb sysops go trouble ziping unarchived file nt supply archived distribution version product might get distributed bbs supply disk label recommended asp logo least initial  asp  included label anyone immediately identify disk asp member software summary    distribution disk ready submit various bbs distribution service disk vendor may choose create separate distribution disk use bbs disk vendor however follow step preparing distribution archive file separate  disk vendor  disk probably necessary majority disk vendor able accept distribution filedisk prepared described format
