cysteine body fat nature ice age life insurance back bad old day long ago almost everyone died young generally twenty thirty earlier people lived long enough die obesityrelated cardiovascular disease cancer million died starvation modern agricultural technology brought u cornucopia food gene still programmed time famine fat greatest danger body often hold tenaciously warm body fat security blanket especially inherited  fat  gene body build proven inherited making especially difficult job get fat particularly keep scandinavian study twin separated birth adoption showed genetics responsible least whether one lean medium fat build home environment adopting parent provably responsible even part adoptee body build though might minor effect small detect another scientific study shown people lose weight calorie restricted diet regain every pound within one year success rate worse cure rate terminal cancer diet quack keep telling people count calorie go hungry lot thing diet quack nt tell nt tell use caloric restriction technique go hungry rest life fat come right back nt tell caloric restriction make hunger weight controlling hypothalmus gland brain think famine consequently change body biochemistry make efficient causing weight plateau even potentially dangerous starvation diet nt tell caloric restriction actually shuts efficient body fat reduction mechanism nt tell losing weight regaining much worse futile weight loss versus fat loss probably know losing weight losing fat may know low calorie diet accompanied heavy exercise weight lose lean body mass fat even heavy exercise still lean body mass loss weight regain stop dieting almost entirely fat however frequently cycle eating normal eating lowcalorie diet actually end le muscle mass started though weight show body fat percentage measurement contest result certainly show however reason recommend low calorie diet way lose body fat morever remember people lose weight lowcalorie diet regain within year restricting one food intake willpower unnatural way lose body fat delicious fattening food around readily available recommend method use natural body mechanism fat control unnatural selfstarvation willpower ice age ancestor willing go hungry could get food human specie would extinct new scientific research finding recent year uncovered natural body mechanism getting rid body fat work body rather making job getting fat keeping relatively easy technique require going low calorie diet hungry extra work perhaps important dedicated body builder cause loss lean body mass require drug use nearly ifbb aau olympic legal completely natural glycemic index key concept fat hunger energy control popular magazine recently stated calorie table sugar likely fatten calorie potato potato contains lot complex carbohydrate body break wrong fact calorie potato likely fatten calorie pure table sugar something discovered within past year called glycemic index become well established theory among scientist studying obesity ratio hormone insulin released response increase blood sugar growth hormone natural anabolic nonsteroid hormone stimulates muscle building fat burning play mojor role controlling body ratio fat muscle insulin necessary hormone without body cell could burn glucose blood sugar circulating bloodstream energy however much insulin result conversion excess glucose bloodstream stored fat remember stored fat life insurance policy famine gene nt realize living th century america enough food survive body especially young adulthood still tends accumulate store fat use food shortage  emergency  recent research also indicates individual secrete extra large amount insulin response carbohydrate extra risk cardiovascular disease thus good nondiabetics well diabetic keep blood glucose  insulin level  control carbohydrate created equal brings u glycemic index carbohydrate sugar starchy food increase blood level glucose broken sugar digestive tract absorbed big difference much particular carbohydrate increase blood sugar fast scientist studying could advise diabetic eat found surprising thing complex carbohydrate like potato increased blood sugar level simple sugar like sucrose table sugar found candy bar etc devised way comparing different carbohydrate called glycemic index glycemic index particular food ratio much certain quantity food increased blood sugar divided much quantity glucose increased blood sugar multiplying ratio glycemic index meant food increased blood sugar much glucose number higher represent food increase blood sugar glucose number lower represent food increase blood sugar le glucose using glycemic index give real insight physiological effect food eat table sugar sucrose glycemic index natural fruit sugar fructose glycemic index honey whopping glycemic index whole wheat bread glycemic index higher yetch white bread much higher pure table sugar hand whole grain rye bread glycemic index corn wheat product much higher glycemic index rye oat product corn wheat oat rye used cattle fattening feed lot sedentary cattle eat corn wheat lot insulin released causing blood sugar made ingested carbohydrate rapidly enter cattle fat storage cell get converted stored body fat huge insulin release drive much blood sugar cattle fat storage cell blood sugar drop normal making crave carbohydrate start whole hungerfeedingfattening cycle help avoid fattening like feedlot cattle watching glycemic index eat corn wheat product high glycemic index however pasta general low glycemic index even made corn wheat flour may scientific reason pasta important pritikin weight loss program give eating sweet eat delicious sweet dessert snack sweetened fructose lowest glycemic index carbohydrate tested get fructose health food store diabetic section large supermarket sold mainly diabetic use instead regular sucrose advice physician also find jam made fructose cold acid condition found citrus energy drink fructose actually sweeter calorie per calorie sucrose losing fat putting muscle pigging ice cream ice cream even sweetened table sugar sucrose glycemic index probably due emulsion structure ice cream slowing absorption sugar compared skimmed milk indeed home made ice cream using fructose instead sucrose glycemic index low measure cause significant measurable blood sugar increase even eaten many diabetic patient one body builder saw durk talking ice cream glycemic index body fat one durk appearance merv griffin show thought whole idea crazy set prove eating two three pint ice cream per day addition regular diet also used nutrient human growth hormone releasers durk discussed upcoming issue durk sandy newsletter feature article gh releasers use ten week ice cream piggery lost   waist added  chest weight loss  pound since put muscle losing fat fat loss substantially greater weight loss compare going hungry calorically restricted diet lose muscle along fat see life extension weight loss program detail case history limit validity case history type study case history unlike scientific animal experiment doubleblind placebo controlled experiment human never prove anything sometimes provide interesting research lead eating meal mixed food eating combined meal effect glycemic index attenuated high glycemic index food generally le effective increasing blood sugar level mixed food especially lot soluble fiber fat food thus glycemic index used effectively compare individual food item snack athletic carbohydrate preloads important safety note consumption large amount fructose serious adverse cardiovascular effect copper deficient according u department agriculture scientist half american copper deficient play safe take mineral supplement fda recommended daily allowance copper milligram per day preferably chelated form thermogenesis cool way lose fat  fat body major mean getting rid extra fat discovered within past year called thermogenesis small deposit special fat body called brown fat compared ordinary fat whitish color look brown brown fat evolved perform one special task burn regular white stored body fat create heat keep body warm thermogenic heat generating brown fat deposit activated cold eating certain type food sustained heavy exercise stimulus even though brown fat deposit amount body fat amazing effect body fat percentage activated burn weight white fat every twelve hour thermogenesis versus exercise fat loss amazingly exposure cold effective way lose excess body fat heavy exercise experimental animal exposed moderate cold allowed eat wanted actually ate food exercised animal lost body fat necessary shivering cold take advantage body fat loss mechanism however ordinary street clothes thermogenesis turn degree f uncomfortable temperature wear le thermogenesis turn even higher temperature typically degree f someone nude wearing short use technique fat loss without dietary change even exercise turning thermostat cool weather one degree fahrenheit week setting air conditioner one degree fahrenheit week cause become thermogenically activated cold adapted visitor may find home somewhat chilly wo nt amazed much eat yet remain lean effect worth pound fat loss per year someone starting normal body fat percentage unlike caloric restriction becomes le effective lose body fat three piece suit help make fat body builder posing brief help make lean type clothes wear help make either fat lean calorie content food simply measure heat energy released burn food body like heat calorie released burn log fireplace house little insulation lot drafty heat leak burn lot log lot calorie keep home warm also true clothes clothes keep heat keep calorie calorie stored body fat clothes let heat let calorie difference three piece wool worsted suit equally socially acceptable tropical weight suit pound body fat per year exercise body temperature allowed rise another way stimulate thermogenesis since brown fat must keep burning white fat maintain body temperature swimming ideal since able heavy sustained type exercise produce benefit including cardiovascular conditioning without increasing body temperature inhibits thermogenesis prefer weightlifting better muscle building peak output form exercise use fan air condition body exercise use variable speed fan blow hot air away cool evaporating sweat thereby allowing body remain cool stimulates thermogenesis last thing want work sweat suit keep body heat depressing brown fat thermogenesis lose sweat suit nearly sweat water salt fat think cool lose body fat driving around air conditioned cadillac nothing jogging brief struggling along jogging sweat suit work hard defeat important fat loss mechanism certain food enhance brown fat thermogenic activity low carbohydrate diet real turnoff thermogenesis carbohydrate stimulate thermogenesis however carbohydrate equally effective natural fruit sugar fructose twice good stimulating thermogenesis regular table sugar sucrose yet release  much insulin fat storing hormone ever eaten big meal awakened middle night back neck covered sweat experiencing diet induced thermogenesis biggest deposit brown fat back neck low fat diet also reduces thermogenesis experimental animal fed typical high fat american diet exposed cold ended le body fat animal fed low fat diet recent study indicate one calorie fat typical american diet high low see life extension weight loss program information special fat called mcts medium chain triglyceride strongly stimulate thermogenesis stored body fat even make burn regular body fat even aau olympic competition though use supplement containing essential amino acid nutrient lphenylalinine along vitamin mineral cofactor required body convert noradrenaline brain version adrenaline give
