likely find prime computer learn dsm distributed system management util ities editprofile utility primo user editor several others  editprofile editprofile utility used add delete modify user prime computer running primo similar vaxvms authorize utility three mode editprofile access system initialization si mode system administrator sa mode project administrator pa mode probably never using editprofile system initialization mode mode used initial system user setup sa mode allow perf orm wholesale user modification whereas pa mode allow perf orm modification user project decided try editprofile system hacked type ok editprofile give error message obviously nt good enough pri vileges nt give hope however way around unfort unantly though method must use beyond scope tutorial involves programming high level language fortran iv fortr pl subset g et al well knowledge appropriate system call make lot research experiment might get lucky hand allows invoke editprofile disp lay utility herald revision number serial number copyright inform ation message stating mode mode message one system administrator mode project administrator mode sa mode account using sys privilege thats best remote standpoint get deep use editprofile properly mention source code derfully useful program security audit feature added last year circa log successful failed command way discovered around remove logging procedure code recompile online pretty advanced stuff advised rate best maintaining presence system use editprofile overly much fact nt use unless must generally use editprofile per hack get obtain full userproject listing future hacking purpose ca nt obtain account password within editprofile obtain full user project listing well add modify delete user get user list try hack account wontonly adding user account sensible get add ing user must add user add one need add user need one user easier hide  use common sense guy editprofile invoked dispatched mercilessly   prompt obtain help type help press return get adding user discus procedure pulling user list similar information get full information system project user etc simply need type listsystem abbreviate listsystem command l list individual system attribute substituting new argument place argument see l argument available type help experiment available  list  command editprofile attempting add user prime system always list system attribute know project group use decide add superuser make sure add common project usually default highaccess group example seen administrator projectadministrators operator netmgt etc adding superusers always good idea never add user system also try follow naming convent ion used system user first name user id add user make sure new user user id first name likewise user initial user id make sure new user user id initial add user type adduser username  username  user id wish use type asked password enter password wish use asked group default login project like said use  list  command see group use group always start period give administrator group good project entry default usually suffice easier method add user use like argument try adduser username like system  username  name user id wish use arg ument adduser command make copy user called system found prime seen also user superuser class add copy new user different name set password changeuser command type changeuser username pw prompted new password ta da user id stats user id  system  occasionally upon adding user may add user id file called logufd located one ufd mfd generally happen simply correct one account advised wontonly delete user edit also try use changesystemadministrator command basis type help start exp eriment careful make sure keep track change make case mess something fix get foot wet find pa mode regard ing project administrating thus add user project delete user project etc mean adding superusers etc  distributed system management dsm utility dsm utility set command service help admini

find enjoyable learning difference many mail system available wo nt discus use mail system discus due lack space pose problem online help available prime computer inc old mail system invoked typing mail typical runofthemill mail system difficult figure use prime computer inc also created primo implementation unix xmail system seems preferred electronic mail system easy use mention powerful favorite electronic mail server netmail written cunning prog rammer bramalea software system firm created loginsentry netmail mail server useful feature get normal feature sending usertouser mail locally similarly con figured site network also send courtesy copy user encapsulated nonsam file courtesy copy basically message forwarding assume wrote memorandum wanted people board trustee get copy send cc courtesy copy file encapsulation feature make netmail pseudofile transfer application like ft file transfer service prime answer unix ftp utility say wrote useful public domain program want distribute user local system remote system nt want get source encapsulate executable file compiled program mail encapsulated file recievers read mail able tell netmail save file directory nice site use customwritten mail utility depends rather userfriendly easy learn without documentation dont forget online help file  ed primo text editor ed primo text editor lineoriented opposed fullscreen using vt similar emulation might play around emacs fullscreen editor wo nt discussing emacs come interactive tutorial another reason wo nt discu ussing prime site online separately priced product runoff another separately priced product fully equipped word processor ed hand come primo always available invoke primo editor type ok ed enter ed empty workspace creating new file edit existing filesystem object type ok ed filename enter ed empty workspace dumped input mode everything type taken input file creating tell ed load file edit ie ed filename dumped edit mode everything type taken ed editing comm ands switch input edit mode issue null line say press return key brings new problem mind make blank line press return alone switch mode yes shortcoming primo user used standard text editing system create null line type space press return look null really treated line character length ed take note input mode edit mode use prompt ok illustrate learned far consider pretend session ed line editor ok ed input hey pretty nice nice text editor heh ok let see damn wordwrap remember press return end character ok let go edit mode  edit wow bad wow input oops wow ed command discus ed edit mode command minute let quit edit q file modified ok quit ok okay back primo command line damn forgot save newlycreated text nt panic text still floating around primo memory restore ed session type ok start  continues break ok start  resume edit mode let test shall ok start edit file sampletext q ok alright comment order normally done docu ment would file text away quit try quit without saving new text change made text told file modified asked verification quit make booboo save text using one start command variation two edit mode command learned file abbreviated fil file text current ufd quit abbreviated q exit ed primo command line alternate command save text save command abbreviated sa prefer save file save also used microcomputer use whichever prefer however great feature start command illustrated say mov ing around ufd end trying create file directory nt w write access oh save new cpl prog ram created simple using technique learned move different ufd one w access save text first get edit mode quit editor primo command line use command get home ufd attach different one issue start command file text voila nice trick forgetful know basic primo line editor create new file scratch append text existing file save abort modification recover text accidentally quit hit break key send break signal nt know edit text within existing file insertdelete text existing file really easy read caveat primo normally us  double quote kill erase character respectively typing input mode kill entire line  similarly erase previous character find  character integral document probably fix simple primo command line type ok term erase ctrlh ok term kill press controlh say ctrlh make erase character backspace kill character delete key substitute whatever char acters feel comfortable microcomputer detail term command fully part v section entitled customizing environment another caveat semicolon character end line force linefeed pressed return instead end line either return semicolon useful return key broken enter line text containing semicolon line one line three ed take output line one line three instead line one line three depending upon location semicolon may produce linefeed mode switch thus line text caveat switch input mode edit mode avoid semicolon end line text detail method use get around want semicolon file wish editinsertdelete line text within existing file learn ed address text buffer assume loaded file ed edit mode basis example ok ed examplefile edit ok let view entire file p null text file using example change file around see editadddelete text file null bottom example used p display content p abbreviation print command see told ed print first line file buffer print display specified number line example make last line displayed thecurrent line null part file rather marker mark place insert text bottom indicates bottom file type print p simply say null type print p without numeric argument print default value conversely print n n whole number command cause ed display file backwards get top bottom file type top  abbreviation bottom  abbreviation b simple see line number current line pointing type bottom since print command bottom file let go line type point set ed pointer line number ed tell line displaying line screen abbreviate point command typing po instead try command also abb reviated form w type w line ok know move around file display line text contains next command abbreviated n move pointer specified number line towards bottom file assuming specified number positive negative number move pointer per po command new pointer line displayed two example n editadddelete text file n  text file using example find text bufferm use locate command abbreviated l exam ple find string change file type l change file change file around see look see type w line aha locate command find specified string set pointer new line try locate string aunt jamima type l aunt jamima bottom ed could find string text new pointer bottom meaning last line file similar locate find command abbreviated f find check see specified string beginning line ie first character column second column forth example find editadd editadddelete text file locate find display line reset pointer new loc ation string found find return bottom set point er bottom file nfind similar command work opposite manner find comm nfind abbrevated nf locate first line current line begin specified string following example ill display use nfind command well display method may use multiple ed command one line edit p null text file using example change file around see editadddelete text file top nfind change file around see see nfind find first line start specified string also note use comma command delimeter issuing top nfind command like locate find nfind also return bottom set pointer end file find line starting string specify also find nfind string pattern line starting column po ition format option displayed f change file change fie around see parenthesis required space command append text end current line use append command abbrevi ated append  end last line type po editadddelete text file  editadddelete text file  must space append command string wish append instead typed  would gotten editadddelete text file use change command abbreviated c change string current line first character change command used delimeter complicated command ed command format changestringstring g n string original string string replacement string g specifies global change g ommitted first occurance string changed n pointer value default value change made current line assuming g option use n value ed inspect make change n line starting current line sual ed reset pointer last line inspected file contain fewer n line ed make specified change line file end saying bottom wish change string containing slash  change delimeter character substitute new delimeter character example f editadddelete text file  change editadddelete text file  c editadddelete text file  cfeb editadddelete text file feb always issue top command prior making global file change insert character beginning line use change like po editadddelete text file feb clast line  last line  editadddelete text file feb remember dilema semicolon character say want semicolon file let put semicolon file first let mark want ed put semicolon po last line  editadddelete text file feb c   last line  editadddelete text file feb top c g last line  editadddelete text file feb know want semicolon start use char acter nt plan using elsewhere file like charact er place desire perform procedure voila instant semicolon thought could nt done delete command file use delete command abbreviated believe nt like second line example file let delete type po top p null text file using example last line  editadddelete text file feb null line ed command delete deletes current line delete delete first line file rather current line delete delete fifth line current line starting line current line last ed command go retype command abbreviated r retype delete tge current line replace specified string notice text example nonsensical second line sentance fragment hacker spell correctly grin let fix grammatical error po last line  editadddelete text file feb r learn editadddelete text file learn editadddelete text file retype followed space return delete current line make null line used alternate method creating null line delimit paragraph text opposed making line blank space let look original example file present form original text file using example change file around see editadddelete text file current text file using example learn editadddelete text file useful mean using ed upload text document source host prime simply load file microcomputer go terminal program editor change occurances null line space return enter ed upload file via ascii protocol might need lower sending speed line delay seem sending text fast ed get done send enter edit mode save file text warning filename specify ed save text exists cur rent ufd ed overwrite file text buffer care ful use existing filename save file might sorry important note primo filename filename character long filename contain following character az  first character number embedded blank special character like etc character mapped upper case primo legal filename illegal filename myfile file
