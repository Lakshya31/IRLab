mixture solid lump regulator speed slow speed mixture burn possibility cover case oxidizing agent nitrate chlorate perchlorate provide oxygen usually consist metal ion actual oxidizing radical example potassium nitrate contains metal ion potassium oxidizing radical nitrate instead potassium could instead substitute metal like sodium barium strontium chemical would still supply oxygen burning mixture le desirable sodium nitrate example absorb moisture air make harder control speed mixture burn following example use letter  x  show presence generic metal ion note nitrate stingy oxygen give give one third nitrate nitrite oxygen xno  xn chlorate generous hand give oxygen furthermore give easily take le heat le shock get oxygen loose mixture using chlorate burn spectacularly smaller volume mix need wasted oxidizer ease oxygen supplied make burn faster mixture also much sensitive shock chlorate chloride oxygen xclo  xcl perchlorate round usual set oxidizing tool perchlorate contain even oxygen chlorate also give however sensitive chlorate make mixture  safer  le likely explode drop strike perchlorate chloride oxygen xclo  xcl reducing agent like sulfur charcoal carbon simply burn oxygen produce sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide usually best include mixture two pyrotechnic mixture burn different speed temperature proper combination help control speed combustion also extra fast burning speed needed like rocket firecracker metal powder often added finer powder faster burning rate proportion change speed well magnesium powder dust often used speed aluminum dust work well zinc dust used case powdered metal dust particularly aluminum iron often used produce mixture shoot spark burn rare case desirable slow burning speed case corn meal often used burn act reducing agent nt
