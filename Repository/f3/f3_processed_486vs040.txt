mentioned advantage mmu case provision two parallel path code data resulting overall speedup operation segmentation intel x family implement segmentation family earlier intel system plagued upper kbyte segment size limit starting segment sizecan made high gbytes maximum size physical memory effectively removing segmentation feature decision user therefore far segmentation concerned mc comparable edge since allows user implement segmentation needed avail oneself advantage paging mmus system feature paged virtual memory management offer single standard page size kbytes page size

case strong advantage mc obvious since atcs encompass much memory atc miss probability considerably smaller thus le time wasted accessing page table memory resulting faster overall operation level protection offer four level protection mc two supervisor user whole family protection mechanism much sophisticated segmentation encapsulation information offer reliable protection also result
