household item entire process carried kitchen matter hour following instruction final stage one verify success procedure actually watching crystal mescaline precipitate solution one kilo  lb dried peyote button may yield gram pure white needle crystal mescaline depending upon potency plant used average yield gram usual underground price kilo dried peyote range   per button indian southwestern usa price closer  per button street price gram pure mescaline one lucky enought find one obtain kilo peyote worth mescaline san pedro employed one may anticipate yield gram mescaline per kilo dried cactus one legally purchase kilo dried san pedro extract worth mescaline note elric price dollar neither peyote mescaline commonly available day san pedro cactus still legally avialble cactus store

aluminum ware liquid concentrated thickness cream quart stop boiling stir g sodium hydroxide carefully slowly react liquid make mescaline soluble benezene le soluble water large separatory funnel avilable pour liquid add ml benezene carefully shake funnel well minute let stand hour separatory funnel available process carried one gallon jug siphon attached standing hour water layer settle bottom benzene layer float top two layer thin emulsion layer mixed water benzene drain water emulsion layer using separatory funnel siphon benzene layer using makeshift jugsiphon aooaratus certain neither water emulsion layer get benezene layer separating layer get benzene separation pour everything back separator let stand repeat separation carefully better leave benzene layer water emulsion get water emulsion benzene nothing wasted benzene contains mescaline eventually salavaged sometimes layer fail separate properly case immerse funnel jug deep pot hot water two hour break emulsion bring separation prepare solution part sulfuric acid part water never add water acid splatter add acid little time water pouring inside graduate measuring cup containing water add drop acid solution one drop time benzene extract stopper jug shake well minute thenlet stand minute white streak mescaline sulfate begin appear benzene appear shake jug vigorously two three minute let settle another minute found extracting mescaline san pedro sometimes necessary shake mixture thoroughly longer time get mescaline streak form probably lower mescaline content plant would also apply peyote high mescaline content streak appear add drop acid solution manner shake let settle minute streak appear add drop acid shake wait minute streak form add drop shake wait minute test solution wide range ph paper show solution ph  allow mescaline sulfate crystal completely precipitate siphon much benzene possible without disturbing crystal bottom jug next step salvage mescaline still water emulsion layer combine benxene siphonings wateremulsion layer shake well together minute let settle hour carefully remove benzene layer treat acid precipitate crystal siphoned benzene watery layer repeat crystal precipitate siphon much benzene possible without drawing crystal siphon next step involves removing remaining benzene crystal two method choose first quickest requires ether dangerious often difficult procure shake crystal remianing benzene pour funnel filter paper benzene passed filter rinse jug ml ether salvage crystal jug pour ether crystal fitler ether passed filter repeat rinsing another ml ether let crystal dry ether available wish use highly combustible substance precipate residual benzene poured beaker jug rinsed several time little benzene added beaker crystal left behind beaker placed heat bath benzene evaporated next step purify mescaline sulfate crystal either method carried dissolve dry crystal ml nearboiling distilled water add pinch activated charcoal norite filter
