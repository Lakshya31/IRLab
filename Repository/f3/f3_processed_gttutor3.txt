 third series tutorial hope found useful new experienced user communication facility  q experience much line noise people call seems see noise screen frequency ask party called see usually told screen clean something wrong system odds twice great line noise place call computer computer call normal easily explainable true odds twice great experience know noise case initiated call incidence noise regardless place call assuming line circuit used case reason terminal mode placing call system set fullduplex operation host mode auto answer half duplex full duplex mean whatever type keyboard get sent screen sent instead communication port travel modem along telephone line answering modem host sytem host system sends back half duplex hand whatever type sent communication port screen obvious every character seen screen placed call gone telephone system half seen host system screen telephone circuit got line noise unidirectional may appear data travel one direction regardless fact seen terminal mode user data must go way reach screen appears link host terminal user never seen host q last tutorial wrote told u mnp arq modem able eliminate line noise part answer still mystery know theory least tell part answer remains mystery moment first recall discussion file transfer protocol utilize form crc mechanism insure receiving system received content packet information without dropped bit picked extra bit crc byte word data result algoritm fold every byte data packet onto way result pattern bit calculated receiving system byte data received compared crc subsequently received mismatch data crc byte get received correctly mnp arq modem implement strategy within data transmitted one modem repackaged modem manufacturer call frame packet transmitted frame followed crc byte word stripped receiving modem used determine frame received correctly line noise simply make crc check fail result automatic retransmission frame see modem acting like computer file transmission using protocol transfer method done free overhead result le rated speed every case theoretical maximum data rate baud modem character per second mnp arq modem sending character sending system error thus automatic retransmission frame sending modem likely ask sending computer wait estimated overhead even without error result degradation term maximum possible performance modem yielding character per second possible throughput counter built degradation modem strip start stop bit byte send bit rather eleven sent nonerrorcorrecting modem increase efficiency net effect assuming error possibility rated performance possible get character per second rather error also fails account additional compression method built modem confusion well assumes stream data sent framed modem function user merely typing one two character word time side responds mystery indeed character typed sent downline presumably timeout kind modem say another character entered within x millisecond presumed frame complete sent along crc however practice seem effective eliminating line noise q mnp arq modem faster eliminate line noise sound like way go negative usage interesting question assuming use protocol transfer method addition error detection correction logic modem think couple negative moment first course lack standard particularly higher baud rate second fact every time use one call system use mnp arq vast majority automatically lose part opening screen let explain mnp arq modem first connects another modem calling modem issue sequence byte asking answering modem also mnp arq byte include id indication level mnp example caller using first set character come back called modem consumed modem rather passed user screen thus lost system often necessary calling system user press enter key order cause subsequent character passed modem telling effect turn mnp arq annoyance terminal mode user worse host system introduction release  gt powercomm controversy existence opening prompt issue asks caller want use ansi graphic many user seem mildly annoyed selection recorded somewhere nt answer prompt fail understand prompt several reason mnp good example mean possibility noise line mnp call come initial character mentioned hit prompt result reissuance permit default prompt go past noise mnp time n entered mnp sequence handshake signalling done initial prompt first question user would asked would first name ask sysop many garbage name user base reasonably assure system leading prompt protect noisy incoming call mnp q baud theoretical limit technology term modem hardly appears baud stretch reliability limit today unconditioned telephone system modem exist much much faster already  bit per second modem functional conditioned line even limit well know satellite communication capability exist already permit transfer million bit per second past year rather constant rate improvemnt aspect data processing technology rule thumb pretty close consider every four year three fold improvement performancecapacity two fold increase price sometimes forget long trend effect ibm advertisement year back made pretty clear time ad suggested automobile industry enjoyed rate improvement past year data processing industry enjoyed every adult country could afford roll royce would cost incidently would get  mile gallon gasoline contemporary example need look back original ibm pc machine
