allow page subslst sub sub latter two file exist data must create dummy file order prevent program aborting several people asked program contain feature similar subedit program written richard ruffner reason rather simple ran mr ruffner program first came almost year ago particularly like time couple us discarded thus due failing memory hehe even remember richard program looked like feature contained suppose could look think still copy looking program honestly say mine clone program near future hope release subed correct remaining bug subed mainly unexpected abort due poor programming part may improve upon crude form letter situation welcome suggestion reader may offer  ansi menu system preliminary proposal intuition designing menu bb long problem developer bb software sysops bb run software due size user screen modem speed restriction often timeconsuming expert user looking obscure function  net  complicated beginning user embedded ansi code change color certain portion menu highlighting key command may solve latter problem compounding former wwiv command constantly changing addition modification user find constantly checking menu find command use offline reader see prefix local solution frustrating problem fortunately yes article explains possible method placing menu remote user hard drive ram called simple keystroke scrolled view command menu would invoked ansi code around byte sent local bb side connection naturally system without drawback first user ansi menu capability easily eliminated sending ansi menu detect code much like wwiv  sends ansi detect code remote system ansi menu capability respond another code containing version number ansi menu driver bb attempt prevent sending code intended future release ansi menu next come problem user old version certain bb menu example sysop may add new command main menu mod recently added solved bb sending code requesting version menu remote side running older version user would receive new menu file transfer initiated bb terminated user  ansi menu driver alert user receive new packet ansi menu give user choice receiving packet aborting transfer question  time remaining current message sub number title go  come current solution problem place time remaining along statistic status line top screen include bb name user node number time remaining editing function status insert mode percentage current menu line number since menu would scroll display entire menu message sub prompt would go bottom line menu menu would two status line  bar  much screen menu take would left user unless bb need certain amount line edit message would necessitate code lock unlock size menu would permit expert quickly scan menu looking mod command permitting beginner gradually browse available command since size would affect page pauser  pause  yet another ansi menu command would sent remote system telling bb many line available actual display clearly system incomplete openended technicality storage format menu implementation current terminal program differing system amiga ibm macintosh etc present problem unaddressed article encourage anyone suggestion email wwivnet list current ansi menu code available due space constraint included article want copy code email wwivnet information two code start escape character xb hexadecimal  octal   character letter command identifying bb remote system finish fourbyte hexadecimal value ascii format string whose length determined another command  watchdog council creator otoole area code recent uproar single sysop way recount detail whole ordeal story little different sysop end result sysop got entire state alabama boycotted sysop spread misinformation removal wwivnet got support boycott something like able happen group organization large wwivnet someone watch everything happening someone watching close enough event like boycott take place may say ac gc random protect net ac gc already processing net much needed addition time something like random already take care wwiv software update network software update wwiv support rule regulation wwivnet bb clear ac gc random handle entire network make sure wrongful thing occur take care believe watchdog council must created would consist member region wwivnet member would power suspend bb net possible expulsion based random say group like could put stop boycotting area code took

dynasty made easier space game simple straightforward menu action game move quickly nt bog also event befall sometimes beyond control add entirely new dimension online game net option using net option play bb increase enjoyment game twofold net option treat bb sort another galaxy may actually take day order carried original version space dynasty networking ability unfortunately bug however version game fixed bug completely networking ability way space dynasty protect new dynasty new player protected turn allows build decent respectable level particular protection clause probably one n icest addition space game seen enjoyed playing space dynasty game available wwiv wish space dynasty would pay attention root atari st game space empire several option space dynasty space empire heavy

responding validation feedback requires incredible amount time particularly busy system lot new user easy solution problem solution nt entail quitting job dropping school order find time validate new user solve problem turn form letter macro feature wwiv form letter       first step process step save time create set form letter send new user validate example board validate user think contribute one way another therefore new user tell intends post great deal send form letter thanking agreeing participate message base user agrees upload new file board send form letter thanking told halfadozen form letter different type new user wwiv offer lot flexibility create form letter think use may want start one form letter one say  validated  may decide design form letter specific user profile done choice many new wwiv sysops nt aware form letter feature work wwiv five easy step sending form letter use ascii text editor wwiv internal editor write form letter save form letter using following naming convention formxxxxmsg xxxx name form letter example filename form letter send new user agree upload formulmsg name form letter  ul  place form letter gfiles subdirectory ie c wwivgfiles send form letter type    mail  prompt type name form letter notice form letter name longer four letter long xxxx due constraint do filename length name aforementioned form letter  ul   upload  type title form letter need limit sending form letter mail prompt may also load memory referring using path name ie  gfilesformulmsg  load formletter memory may use full path name since wwiv preface input c
