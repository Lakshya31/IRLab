nonstandard place might problem aborting search etc tsr program expand keyboard buffer known cause problem note hexedit currently even work tandy clone call  compatible  work problem odd note bug simply somewhat unexpected operating method may find cursor speed hexedit hot hexedit us bios function keypress function therefore go fast keyboard sends keypress info use keyboard accelerator like cruise control pckwik key something similar find marked improvement hexedit spends time waiting keystroke use accelerator pump keystroke hexedit much faster making faster scroll etc note also use do  better use command  mode con rate delay  speed keyboard well though nearly fast cruise control pckwik key hexedit requires do  better might work prior release feature might work properly reason need recent do hexedit need backtrack executable file order configuration find help file etc file saved go along whenever change displayed sector change n display top screen start blinking also every

made directly original file want play around file paranoid trust wonderful undo feature use hebbat file documented page twelve hexedit  mike graham future enhancement enhancement happen phase next big phase conversion turbovision potential enhancement labeled either  soon   tvision   maybe  enhancement labeled  soon  appear next version two enhancement labeled  tvision  appear convert turbovision summer hopefully enhancement labeled  maybe  one nt even decided whether yet soon keyboard remapping implemented next version two allow people change default key whatever happen want final implementation buffered file access unit happening soon nail shut disk thrashing problem day code method actually increase decrease size file order search replace unlikesized search replace string first thought would somewhat waste time ca nt mess around innards executable file much without really knowing informed however people also use hexedit edit binary data file unlikesized search replace would handy okee dokee tvision pulldown window implemented turbovision course partially sort know happen sooner later anyone would suffer implementation menu remember using keystroke year ah well grace user go upon conversion turbovision editing multiple file reality popup calculator thrown turbovision release contextsensitive help enhanced screen customization mouse support maybe page

senior editor computing  wonderful magazine recently put list  bare necessity  application today well hexedit hold pretty well turbovision release hit street point mr lenk editorial really hit home

powerful excellent job text documentation documentation reading right new development happening long going stay powerful printer driver etc point meandering sweated blood hexedit came rest easy hexedit continue evolve long money keep rolling limping crawling revision history reverse chronological order version  april vast improvement  new addition hebbat file added pacify people really want

solved window fault search engine heavily modified remove intermittent problem dealing finding null character finding string overlapped sector boundary undo engine rebuilt ground work fast clean even amazes really dumb bug found sharp eye craig jump routine used shiftf jump sector selected jump next found item would nt jump case dumb dumb dumb documentation overhauled version  february official release clean  known bug abort search undo activity percentdone box added undo engine everything possibly take second two percentdone box facility abort process cleanly also added mono parameter restore function configuration think take break programming hexedit little work next big project still topsecret make efficient programming much enjoyable experience version g february actually fairly bug fix release weird bug appeared editing file size page fifteen hexedit  mike graham evenly divisible go figure modified exit prompt revert old default instead n position bar thing main screen one show byte  know hex thing highlight side top screen bit hard track far away added right bottom screen one two minor thing improved basically version e minor facelift f released also added panic button

inertia  f five year went hexedit turbo profiler found hexedit spends time waiting user keypresses key held quite efficient search could use minor tweak though could undo function using turbo pascal  able compile hexedit k executable unbelievable  speechless version e february managed streamline code k executable file programming glitch exterminated including one miserable bug still amazes minute previous version hexedit required math coprocessor nt know guess left compiler switch wrong position anyway coprocessor never noticed flaw thing like bug thing fixed included idiosyncrasy regarding saving log file general cursor movement stuff cursor routine updated top page cursor automatically pgup net effect scroll file cursor version january several bug fixed release major one undo engine thought worked like charm course many minor change also implemented including changing exit do prompt default changing ff key assignment documentation updated rewrote lot code heavily encapsulate hexedit consists ten source file every major function jump search undo etc unit make faster compiles anyway rewrite caused thing glitch think sorted line code almost line hexeditspecific rest libraryspecific changed default colour something look pretty bland visible monochrome user without utterly disgusting colour previously monochrome user right luck could nt even see prompt stuff configuration section screw colour blame  page sixteen hexedit  mike graham version c january home work see quite minor thing wrong undo fixed release official beta release week fixed glitch configuration section driving absolutely around bend weird sometimes small bug drive nut big one get fixed fast recoded base conversion procedure saved k bargain sure like much though figure decided release one beta version per week way dont people pointing bug already fixed always version two ahead beta tester version january added undo byte jump modified screen layout display total sector total byte release hurried got undo working half hour work  started upload ran knew worked easy test instance gave real testing considerate future beta release mean even word beta nt excuse many sin  version b january took rest added searchreplace also modified hexedit track executable filename rename executable impunity selfmodification still work also help file longer searched path everything looked directory hexedit executable resides version b january nt learn added option select window style totalitarianism guy added procedure search text altt ie youre looking text text humongous file specify find string character least n character long find also added selection caseinsensitive search version c january fixed bug yeah real ugly bug nothing else really changed emergency release something hope repeat guess kind asking release three version two day  documented call base conversion altb coded alth must tired version b january page seventeen hexedit  mike graham version b facelift added altc configuration section modifies exe file directly set colour work nice ca nt lzexe file configured ah well unlzexe use pklite always create batch file uncompresses hexedit run compress occasion need redefine colour course set compress would keep going rare occasion need reconfigure hexedit also added altb base conversion utility minor critter cleaned kind never pop unless
