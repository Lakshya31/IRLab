electrocoin goliath cabinet conversion would rate easy hardest part patience make many cable go board jamma connector going need approximately piece cable connect board jamma connector item find useful ic socket pin ic single push button small switch also need l monitor conversion jamma connector plenty cable suggest read reread document attempt conversion right let get started joust consists board main cpu board rom interboard containing game rom input interface board sound board first thing find appropriate sized piece wood hold board way make interconnection easy acquired wood layed board                                             cpu board main rom board                input interface                              sound board                                  key  interface input interface ram chip battery link board ribbon cable gave excellent access board connector made everything reasonably neat tidy must diagram time given location connector number                                           cpu board main rom board             interface                           sound board                                  aha say forgotten connector well actually nt dont use manual tell memory protect interlock since dont original cabinet figure much use waiting someone prove wrong though one important thing remember must repeat must ground every board together essentially two way take wire one screw board hook next nearest board done solder wire one ground jamma connector important ok perhaps easiest thing start connecting number since involves external connection connector pin pin key pin stop putting connector wrong way round pin connected top bottom connector look like connector connector           pin key pin nc pin nc pin key pin numbered way looking top shown diagram wiring start pin connector connect pin connector pin pin fairly straightforward stuff right let move power board every board exception interface board need power notice connector one connection power input voltage first thing though nt need wire every one long one connected would ok wrong one need connected right connector one need v pin v pin  pin easiest way take connection direct jamma connector take appropriate pin jamma side wire connector ground taken pin pin key pin connector pin ground pin v connector requires power number pin v pin v pin ground pin v jamma cabinet distinct lack v wire v nt create much problem long volume kept low practice find volume good level without problem let move subject monitor little bit work required first monitor output taken connector starting pin pin red pin green pin blue pin video ground pin horizontal sync pin vertical sync pin composite sync existance composite sync pin documented interboard wiring manual exist assure wire corresponding pin correct one jamma connector use pin must feed line hex invertor get l chip also advise buy chip socket rather solder direct leg chip look chip look like  need wire pin ground   pin v pin connector pin   pin inverted sync line take   jamma connector sync pin p       btw  denotes notch chip   never good ascii drawing  input decoder smallest board pin connector assume side furthest cable feeding main board pin give u pin player move left pin player move right pin player flap rest first bank connected second connector pin  pin player move left pin player move right pin player flap pin player start pin player start pin ground right let push sound board connector nearing completion thing connector easy pin furthest away dip switch push button pin used pin go speaker pin speaker minus jamma connector l jamma respectively next thing volume well short term measure simply put meg ohm resistor pin connector number really add potentiometer unfortunately cant give figure doc dont give information readily right last mean least switch button used auto upmanual advance respectively switch take pin furthest led nearby ground pin switch advance button use pin another suitable ground find need part pin connector number pin high score reset button pin left coin pin centre coin pin slam pin key notice nt mention pin setup didnt add partly due fact dont want make easy reset score thats logical nt dont use coin switch since switch line coin mechs cabinet need push also set game free play mode sorry cant give information setting coin part thats ready fire game test get ram error may want spare ram handy swap strongly advise check power supply first board extremely unhappy v nt gregg game would run system go message would appear could play short game would always crash problem strange turned power bit worked fine dont get anything screen make sure wired l correctly believe static sensitive device careful exercise correct precaution handling well wrap essentially easy conversion hardest part like say patience strip wire make connection determined nothing stop hope information use someone know written simplistic style intention make easy complete beginner understand hope noone offended writing manner apologises ok well want let know get interested hearing found information useful contact address cheer good luck graham bisset email
