november consumer question answer refrigerant atmosphere information provided public service refrigeration service engineer society heating air conditioning service contractor intended provide clear factual answer question stratospheric ozone depletion done situation affect q ozone ozone gas consists three atom oxygen molecule oxygen breathe contains two atom molecule chemically oxygen ozone ozone layer consists ozone stratosphere high earth altitude mile formed ultraviolet light sun acting oxygen molecule ozone layer absorbs scatter ultraviolet light sun preventing harmful amount ultraviolet reaching earth reason often referred ozone shield q nt ozone unhealthful yes occurs lower atmosphere breathe caused ultraviolet radiation sun acting smog air pollutant hot summer day situation confused protective ozone layer stratosphere ozone ground level harmful pollutant stratosphere protective shield cfc chlorofluorocarbon chemical cfc stand contain chlorine fluorine carbon may contain hydrogen chemical inexpensive safe nonflammable refrigerant high thermal efficiency also used solvent cleaning electronic microcircuit blowing agent manufacturing foam insulation us well many country cfc still used aerosol propellant cfc general term often used inaccurately compound important realize cfc equally suspected affecting atmosphere cfc contain chlorine hydrogen fully halogenated cfc real problem contain chlorine fluorine hfc contain hydrogen along chlorine hcfc far smaller effect q cfc ozone layer certain chlorinecontaining refrigerant stable break lower atmosphere even hundred year released chemical gradually float stratosphere chlorine reacts ozone causing change back oxygen chlorine used reaction molecule go cause ozonetooxygen reaction q chemical effect yes brominecontaining compound contained certain halon fire extinguisher also implicated potential ozone depletion bromine chemically related chlorine q result depletion ozone layer could result increased exposure ultraviolet radiation point future best available scientific information indicates proper action taken reduce consumption fully halogenated cfc avoid possible future effect human environment potential effect include increase skin cancer cataract inability resist certain infectious disease decreased yield agricultural crop effect marine life essential food chain q ozone hole read thinning ozone layer antarctica occurs antarctic spring season autumn northern hemisphere occurs antarctic continent due unique climate caused powerful circumpolar wind extremely low temperature lowest earth area carefully monitored degree ozone thins since found lead ozone depletion part world well significantly reduced ozone level detected high chlorine level found instrumented aircraft flight layer indicate ozone depletion problem may serious initially thought q nt stop using cfc spray can reason early cfc used aerosol propellant constituted total cfc consumption u following concern initially raised professor sherwood rowland dr mario molina epa food drug administration banned use cfc aerosol propellant essential application use cfc reduced u approximately unfortunately country followed u ban many practical us cfc production use surpassed pre level q greenhouse effect cfc may involved problem also greenhouse effect occurs carbon dioxide mostly form burning fossil fuel oil natural gas coal gas methane nitrogen oxide others build atmosphere gas let incoming sunlight heat reach earth block earth heat radiating space way greenhouse work name effect gas build heat trapped planet temperature rise scientist feel cfc may also contributing effect q done stop depletion ozone layer scientist around world recognize importance severe result problem realize country must cooperate stop erosion ozone shield fall representative nation meeting montreal canada signed agreement known montreal protocol u canada included august u environmental protection agency epa enacted provision agreement regulation united state montreal protocol epa specify july production consumption certain cfc limited level produced consumed actually mean cutback use grown since time july level reduced level july specifically chemical involved fully halogenated cfc halon also covered different time schedule scientific technological economic concern reviewed least every four year first review recent technical information indicates even deeper cut production use may necessary head epa stated chemical completely eliminated responsible industry trade group agree lost come need refrigerant important remember fully halogenated refrigerant phased refrigerant home refrigerator freezer automotive air conditioning mostly cfc one regulated central home air conditioning typically us hcfc period time new appliance redesigned use hcfc place fully halogenated cfc manufacturer electronic microcircuit us cfc clean part successfully switching chemical manufacturer foam insulation use cfc produce insulating bubble insulation method chemical used although produce insulation le efficient new replacement refrigerator also developed require year testing toxic effect make sure safe q ca nt switch refrigerant yes going take time hfc hcfc refrigerant replace cfc refrigeration air conditioning equipment redesigned manufactured existing refrigerant refrigerator example simply removed replaced one refrigerant compressor cooling coil component system designed specific refrigerant used different refrigerant different characteristic affect compressor component system lubricating oil also developed compatible new hcfc hfc q situation affect u mentioned insulation manufactured using method chemical result le efficient greater thickness insulation used get insulating effect mean refrigerator freezer either larger outside smaller inside refrigerated truck make larger outside course cargo capacity reduced carrying le frozen food per trip mean somewhat higher transportation cost may increase price pay necessary change processing frozen food may also result increased cost refrigerator freezer system using cfc redesigned refrigerant probably slightly le efficient using electricity operation may also somewhat heavier price air conditioning service contractor pay refrigerant increase result shorter supply help control cost make supply go farther service technician take step conserve recover reuse refrigerant increasingly important find repair leak system rather adding refrigerant periodically existing residential appliance system become obsolete replaced sooner owner operator large commercial air conditioner refrigeration system probably notice great many change homeowner thoroughly prevent escape cfc atmosphere wisely conserve recycle material better protect health generation come protect environment control overall cost long run information copied october jerry j trantow research scientist johnson control inc e michigan
