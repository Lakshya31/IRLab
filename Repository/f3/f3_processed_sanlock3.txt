marked plus figure plus mean nothing marker key would inserted lever figure inside lock turn key would lift lever bar would lifting disk cylinder hold key proper height relationship lever rotates key axis tumbler come stack two three way fifteen tumbler common pivot point individual spring key reach tdc top dead center lift tumbler correct height based level depth key bitting well level gate area cutout bottom lever following closely able realize type lock much disc us retangular cut lever instead wedge cut disc one small note remember lever lock simple design dead lock picking lever lock new type technique used individually lifting tumbler proper height tension wrench lock different one used pick disk tumbler lock figure slight size difference lever lock common use type tension wrench   figure lever lock tension wrench part wrench marked   part change length may differ wrench wrench depending upon lock meant pick   dimension correct size wrench corresponds length key cylinder cut tip   dimension longer get proper pick manipulation usually buy set somehow generally four five different size try making nt recommend absolutely must make try bending one  music wire grinding side flat lifter normal set work disc pin tumbler also work lever basic idea behind lever tumbler picking apply unlocking tension bolt make stump bear inner edge locked position cutout tension lockpicker use lifter pick raise individual gate lined stump one begin picking gate back lock gate stump gate align stump gate make contact gate catch stump long tension released tumbler held unlocked position even lifting pressure removed feel two contacting quite noticeable might even hear might also notice tension wrench jump slightly occurs could feel little lessening resistance come back right away lift warning lift tumbler mean start common pain butt mistake lock even little thing inside detects lifting permanently lock lock triggered lifted first tumbler one furthest back proceed next one going back front may notice slight lessening tension may feel tumbler entering gate feel le le go tumbler lined bolt move unlocking lock something watch lock make cut tumbler extreme degree meaning one tumbler cut deep possible next cut shallow possible way possible disk pin tumbler lock good security becomes difficult lift one tumbler high enough without touching causing misalignment tumbler one thing expect lever tumbler lock highlowhighlowhigh etc combination good lock another thing always remember lifting fatal way get overlifted tumbler back release tension probably cause tumbler drop well also tumbler drop right finish lifting go immediately back nt forget go back front since usually bind strongest back getting weaker get closer front closing note lever lock let add often come appears small lever lock actuality merely warded lock spring retainer must lifted bolt moved amount lifting retainer critical lever lock would           concludes chapter lever lock somewhat unclear nt worry cause chance low see lever lock section added complete working knowledge lockpicking ever called upon use end chapter lockpicking next chaper pin tumbler lock possibly depending upon lazy
