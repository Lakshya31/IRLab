inexpensive way creating custom bullet limited instance caliber reducing existing factory bullet smaller size expensive making produce far le accurate bullet limit weight basic style factory bullet giving advantage superior accuracy ability make bullet weight style wish cost saving using jacket lead instead buying readymade bullet seems like quite bit give drawing bullet seems simple lure getting inexpensive bulletproduction die sometimes overwhelms one sense value though nt uncommon someone sacrifice advantage  real power bullet swaging  order draw existing bullet instance  mm two mm diameter sometimes reduction military bullet purchased cheaply quantity process work well enough justify lost advantage nt general cure certainly replace swaging hand jacket draw die make good sense jacket expanded internal lead pressure swaging diameter change made rather unimportant final product ability change standard diameter use existing longer jacket heavier design next smaller caliber good advantage sometimes way obtain good inexpensive jacket  caliber drawn  standard jacket used bullet swagers likewise  caliber one pick little longer draw one side jacket reduction extreme unavoidable without extremely high cost equipment effect primarily cosmetic tip open tip jacket may appear uneven accuracy generally seems unaffected since jacket wall seldom become eccentric normal drawing operation set dy make    caliber bullet jacket commercial  inch length jacket available corbin process making subcalibers involves drawing standard  jacket three stage stopping stage desire jacket must annealed first draw   caliber else end break next draw swaging since jacket   usually shorter  jacket must trimmed point done first draw   using pinchtrim die punch punch made shoulder shoulder tip length determines length jacket jacket extends beyond punch step shoulder sheared punch pass die constriction process work well provided correct jacket used since temper grain diameter well wall thickness somewhat critical proper shearing action usually jacket made quite short drawn longer   stage exact final length bit experimental since variation jacket lot temper wall thickness material composition produce somewhat different final drawn length seems quite consistent within one lot kind jacket jacket bullet draw dy fit reloading press mity mite press require careful adjustment maximum leverage properly utilized push component tightest point die yet still gain maximum stroke within required leverage range case drawing copper tubing make long rifle jacket nt easy way get enough stroke enough power time instance short  helper  punch rod must used jacket drawn two stage first jacket started die using end stroke sufficient power ram drawn back helper rod inserted jacket ram run forward gaining extra stroke push component way ring die admittedly slower way job case thing work hand press dy made hydropress hand seldom difficulty programmable hydropress develops whatever power needed point stroke cycle full six inch stroke work full power top bottom simple job draw length thickness jacket one stroke copper tubing jacket product point advantage hydropress design remember home swaging operation accomplishing task step relatively inexpensive equipment major factory spend ten hundred thousand dollar time equipment accomplish often stage sometimes obvious limitation without bit leeway final length weight sometimes amazing thing process work hand person nt mind experimenting put thing coming bit differently original blueprint might demanded process offer great deal freedom high cost abritrary supply source ability make bullet extremely accurate unusually high performance nt confuse accuracy performance predictable adherence preexisting design concept sometimes way happens come work practical world limited cost simple operation available supply fortunately way come usually pretty darn good
