 welcome playback version c   think many time use computer task maybe logging bulletin board backing hard disk uploading file home office printing letter etc would nt nice could turn recorder record complete task play back one keystroke whenever needed task enter playback playback differs greatly macro program playback replay keystroke rate typed example type program name wait program load playback launch recorded keystroke keyfiles call touch hot key turn standalone program example later let say record sequence log prodigy get stock quote save file exit prodigy import file spreadsheet print result could save task stand alone program call  getstock  would enter  getstock  do prompt wanted replay task even playback replay task later time completely unattended want group several keyfiles together batch file want start stop recording within batch file without user initiation also use included menu program playback keystroke using point select menu menu program also let view content keyfiles delete change playback speed add explanatory note rename launch later time ok last paragraph gave brief overview playback would use hesitate sure scratched surface way used nt want discourage finding application menu program use playback record keystroke start application use menu program launch batch file use playback record  batch  file start recording keystroke using playback save file next time run menu program keystroke sequence saved turned keyfiles use menu program rename whatever want editing nothing record save much normal batch file desktop publishing use menu program launch desktop publisher working large project know create keyfile load file want go page want addition come time print given whole slew option must select every time print page since response always record keystroke play back using playback  hot key  email use playback create keyfile keystroke load modem program load email macro run exit program want instruct playback run sequence automatically certain time email waiting get office one registered user us playback grab stock quote manipulate insert spreadsheet print result one keypress keystroke expander occasion replay set keystroke record use  hot key  whenever want replay fun try creating keyfile writing letter launch later time someone else may watching eerie seeing computer going business writing editing letter one

menu program put hilited keyfile playback keystroke buffer playback keystroke press playback  hot key  ctrlp default edit first released playback nt put keyfile editor thought would easier record new keyfile rather trying edit existing one since playback keep track shift state scan code delay addition ascii value editing keyfile extremely complex task nt long started getting request customer editor result created simple overstrike editor playback let change ascii value delay keystroke file ca nt add delete keystroke ca nt edit shift state ctrl alt shift addition ca nt change nonascii keystroke like pressing f key insert key delete key etc changing ascii value delay example create keyfile gather data different source transfer data somewhere else part transfer process involves inputting today date big keyfile nt want rerecord every day change date case using editor would make lot sense use editor highlight desired file press e edit file listed screen character edit appear ca nt edit appear small dot use cursor key tab home end key position cursor value want change press desired key value change old new cursor move next value may edit many character wish editing keystroke delay much delay occur previous keystroke keystroke cursor displayed lower right corner screen press f increase delay f decrease although displayed edit screen f f also let change delay second step rather step th second time edit process press esc key return menu program without saving change may made want incorporate change keyfile press f want create new keyfile another name press f configure pressing c configure brings another screen information item change listed left screen along current value change particular item use arrow key select item want change press left right arrow key change value selected item change  hot key  need select shift state ctrl alt ctrl alt select key example change playback  hot key  ctrld would first select  playback shift state  press right arrow key  ctrl  appeared press arrow select  playback key  press right arrow indicate want change press desired key clear mud try make sense item need explaining color monitor color monitor select  yes  affect whether menu program display color flickering cursor  flickering  line monitor begin flicker select  yes  else select   buffer size change value change many keystroke keystroke buffer hold remember keystroke add byte amount memory playback us example select keystroke playback take k memory k program k  keystroke buffer boost threshold remember boost work delay certain threshold acted threshold ignored value set threshold found threshold  second work well may want lower raise depending fast type type application playback activating experiment default playback speed playback normally default normal playback speed ie keyfiles play back exact speed recorded change value boost turbo want affect newly created keyfiles remember default still change playback speed individual keyfile using menu program press escape made change menu program reappear playback memory use menu program reboot computer reload playback notice change made hot key buffer size boost threshold rename obviously want rename keyfiles something default name menu program give hi lite desired file press r rename launch press l  launch  another menu drop giving three option launch launch later launch time press n  launch n ow  menu program end hi lited keyfile run immediately pressing l  launch l ater  selects hilited file launched later time time specified right middle screen  launch time  select l ater launch launch time value hilited file time want keyfile launched time nt correct use next option  launch ime  effect delayed launch select one file later launch file selected later launch marked   left name want unselect file already selected later launch simply select mark disappear exit menu program alarm set launch time keystroke keyfile selected later launch one   get loaded playback get played back pressed playback hot key example leave computer night could playback launch keyfile retrieve email right get work morning waiting arrive third option press select  launch ime  let adjust launch time hilited file finished adjusting launch time press return keyfile marked later launch   exit menu program pressing escape file launched time set  note  obviously launching file normally delayed launch wo nt anything playback nt loaded memory insertnote pressing insert key let leave character note content purpose hilited keyfile type note press enter pressing escape let escape without changing note entering note one character length deletes note delete press delete key delete hilited keyfile  keyfile operation  discussed several time keyfiles playback entering name do prompt however couple option also execute do prompt adding command line option keyfiles name storing keyfile want load keyfile playback activate later using playback hot key use command line option     stand store example entering  test  do prompt would load  test  keyfile playback replay press playback hot key delayed launch specific keyfile launched later time using command line option  hhmm   hhmm  digit number first two digit specifying hour hour military time last two digit representing minute digit number must exactly four digit long thing get messed nt seperate hour minute colon anything else example entering  test   would load keyfile  test  playback replay likewise  test   would playback  test  keyfile pm running keyfiles within batch file normally run keyfile batch file last item batch file keyfile load keystroke playback initiate replay keyfile program quits playback go business stuffing keystroke totally background happens run keyfile batch file anywhere last item keyfile load keystokes playback initiate playback end rest batch file continue execute even tho playback keystroke started however due popular demand created batch file command line option let use keyfiles anywhere batch file even put several batch file want call one keyfile inside another append keyfile name  b  command line option specify batch file example  test  keyfile would become  test b  limitation though keyfile must exit do prompt word whatever task keyfile performing must return do prompt finished addition nt need use  b  option using store delayed launch command line option playback keystroke case nt immediate starting stopping recording within batch file instead using hot key start stop recording within batch file using  pb r  start recording  pb  stop recording playback disables hot key recording initiated way must use  pb r  stop recording addition since nt know many keystroke user may enter probably want use  configure  portion menu program greatly increase keyboard buffer size feature real boon looking see user react new piece software create batch file start program us  pb r  initiate recording load software finish  pb  keyfile everthing user heshe tried software  problem   run menu get aborting file message  menu program ca nt find keyfiles information make keyfiles happen two reason obvious nt saved keystroke sequence remember create keyfile need record keystroke sequence press save hot key second reason nt install playback correctly likely nt run initialization program delete playback file return autoexecbat file way reinstall according instruction given earlier playback installed correctly thing wo nt work right  playback nt capture mouse move  right playback capture keystroke mouse program keyboard command well use  playback signaled end recording session descending series beep instructed  attempted record keystroke keystroke buffer hold use menu program increase size keystroke buffer reboot reload playback try  keystroke nt captured  possible program intercept keystroke pas information rest u result situation ca nt get information need situation rare place seen activation tsr program game intercept information coming keyboard act fool computer thinking never key pressed much like happens press one playback hot key addition program take complete control computer many case ignoring previous tsr program microsoft window information using playback within m window consult file  windowstxt  playback disk  trying activate function one application end activating playback instead  function trying
