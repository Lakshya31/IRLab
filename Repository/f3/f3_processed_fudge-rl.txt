leaving lesser number rolled number die either good bad result die left table good die showing example player rolled  trait level bad die showing however rolled  trait level player leave correct number color dice table gm see general result even relatively far away excellent method use convention gm bring enough dice two distinct color say red white player one use color good die game run

player use either method modifier  mean trait reduced one matter hand permanent reduction though likewise modifier temporarily improve character trait example joe good sword hurt  action fair sword fact  relevant trait he healed jill mediocre lockpicking skill exceptionally fine set lockpicks give fair lockpicking skill shes using character secondary trait could contribute significantly task gm may allow  bonus example vern library trying find information obscure south american indian ritual using research skill good also good anthropology skill gm decides significant enough give vern great research skill occasion anthropology skill superb gm would simply let vern use instead research nt get superb anthropology without done lot research condition may grant  trait  extremely large

announces trait rolled fair common degree task skill seems relevant choose appropriate attribute player roll level try match surpass degree task case level success better roll better character worse roll worse character setting degree task gm remember default skill poor fair thus average trained climber climb fair cliff time average untrained climber usually get poor result example section  nathaniel shooting archery target target large close even mediocre archer could expected hit degree task mediocre much smaller farther away perhaps great archer could expect hit regularly degree task great example setting degree task party consists two pc mickey arnold npc guide parri come cliff guide tell climb gm announces difficult impossible cliff degree task good required scale delay complication checking character sheet find parri climbing skill great mickey good arnold character sheet nt list climbing skill level default poor parri mickey decide climb lower rope arnold parri roll  result mean rolled degree superb get cliff without problem much quicker expected mickey roll  however mean rolled degree fair since one degree lower degree task difficulty severely degree task mickey would fallen since slightly degree task though gm simply rule stuck half way ca nt figure go parri tie rope tree top cliff lower mickey gm say poor degree task climb cliff rope place mickey make easily another roll arnold would also need poor rolled degree climb cliff since skill poor decide risk mickey parri arnold loop rope shoulder pull grab handhold along way case slip roll needed case unless suddenly attacked arnold half way cliff occasionally gm roll secret pc time result even failed roll would give player knowledge would nt otherwise usually information roll example gm asks player make perception roll player fails character nt notice anything ordinary player know something ordinary character nt notice far better gm make roll secret mention successful result  opposed action           opposed action resolved side roll two dice appropriate trait announces result trait rolled necessarily example seduction attempt would rolled seduction skill active participant possibly appearance attribute resisting participant may modifier someone vow chastity might get bonus  someone lecherous fault would penalty even try resist rolled degree compared relative degree

attribute winner get item one character trying shove another one roll strength v strength see go someone trying hide search party perception attribute find hidden skill v hide skill camouflage stealth etc trying outdrink rival constitution v constitution drinking skill carousing etc  combat      combat usually handled opposed action combatant determine trait rolling largely depending whether using weapon type combatant make opposed action roll relative degree zero mean combat round standoff combat round indeterminate length time set gm around second seems reasonable people might seem grossly short absurdly long others relative degree zero winner check see hit hard enough damage loser combat round may needed one party may attempt flee negotiate etc melee combat round combine offense defense side one roll round either standoff one winner combatant one side hurt given round ranged combat however may handled way gm may determine initiative perhaps initiative attribute modified circumstance opponent alternate taking pot shot one fighter much smaller pixie fighting human gm ass penalty  even  larger combatant hit small target likewise penalty make aimed shot specific small body part however using objective damage system sure add modifier back damage small target hit one fighter positional advantage penalty usually  fighter worse position example include bad footing lower elevation light eye etc add penalty back damage win opposed action though thing reduce strength blow hence amount damage delivered allout offense berserk attack get  combat skill additional  damage win however allout attacker tie loses opposed action winner get  damage allout defensive stance earns  combat skill combatant harm foe except critical result optionally allout defense successful perception tactic roll also give bonus next round case fighter taking turn scope area maneuver take advantage terrain conditional irregularity similar combat subtlety possible encouraged one combatant unable fight given round possibly unaware attacker critical result previous round see section  critical result combat becomes simply unopposed action active fighter usually fair degree task character defend use shield still opposed action defending character hurt character case  melee combat          melee combat close enough foe use weapon repeatedly without throw weapon used simply fist determines trait fighter us roll otherwise affect opposed action roll combat type weapon affect damage though see section  damage  multiple combatant melee                  one opponent attack single fighter positional advantage least reflect lone fighter  skill additional foe beyond first lone fighter roll result compared opponent rolled degree one solo combatant defeat opponent order inflict wound one lone fighter inflict damage one foe given round choice take multiple wound single round two enemy hit epic campaign heroic pc facing horde enemy gm reduce penalty  two opponent face use rule written give horde poor skill poor damage capacity character horde also possible allow sweeping blow damage one foe time course slows slash reduce damage done foe cut manner also allow pc tie one foe score least two rolled degree better another hit second foe still defended example paco facing three thug rolled great good mediocre result respectively paco roll great result tying best thug gm allows hit thug rolled mediocre result since  rolled degree hit course wellarmored fighter facing weak opponent simply concentrate one foe let others try get armor defend attacker case npc need unopposed fair degree task hit lone fighter ignoring historically accurate knight wading peasant levy example number foe attack single opponent limited course six maximum ideal condition spearwielders wolf three four attack using swung weapon martial art requiring lot space maneuver lone fighter doorway one two fighter reach multiple npc beset lone pc gm may wish roll npc rather roll combatant lone fighter still  per extra opponent gm single roll moved one degree closer zero example gm get  result attacker actually score  zero result remains zero example npc pirate complete eyepatch scar earring sneer general bad attitude attacking dashing pc hero tucker pirate whose name molly annie maggie fair good mediocre respectively combat skill tucker superb swordsman  two extra fighter attacking skill good combat gm want roll applying result three pirate rather rolling three time combat round first round get  becomes  moved closer zero pirate gotten good great fair result respectively tucker score great result round equal best pirate result round standoff nobody take wound either side however tucker scored superb result could hit pirate choice remain unhit poor tucker rolled fair result molly annie would hit next round gm roll  result moved closer zero become zero result fair good mediocre hit pirate  ranged combat          ranged combat may may opposed action target unaware assault attacker make unopposed action roll see hit target gm set degree task based distance lighting cover etc modify attacker skill range partial cover etc included degree task

gm minimum rolled degree task needed hit defensive roll made dodge skill agility attribute something similar ranged weapon thrown modifier defense roll however propelled weapon bow gun beam weapon

missed since nt make degree task another example scarlet shooting longbow greenwood dicken sheriff man crossbow dicken know man next keeled arrow chest dicken open good light range concern scarlet gm say even mediocre shot hit since fairly close range dicken hit course partially hidden behind log cover inside foliage lighting make hard see clearly good roll needed gm decree dicken roll fair result missing roll mediocre result hit dicken even though nt good shot dicken note may seem scarlet lost opposed action hit nt count however actually two opposed action going dicken shot v dodge shot v
