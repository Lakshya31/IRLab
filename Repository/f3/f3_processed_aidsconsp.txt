dr robert gallo bethesda cancer research center maryland proceeding prove claim segal careful note  given preference investigative result highly renowned laboratory whose objective content doubted must emphasize connection know finding published professional journal contradict hypothesis  discovering aid first known case aid occurred new york first described case california virus isolated paris may taken french homosexual returned home ill trip east coast u one year later robert gallo coworkers bethesda cancer research center published discovery virus cytotoxic ie poisonous cell shortly publishing discovery gallo stated newspaper virus developed natural process human adult leukemia virus htlv previously discovered however claim published professional publication soon alizon montagnier two researcher pasteur institute paris published chart htlv hiv showing virus basically different structure also declared categorically knew natural process one two form could evolved according professional  science  magazine fall annual meeting american association advancement science aaa almost entirely devoted question extent new pathogenic agent could produced via human manipulation gene according segal aid practically sole topic discussion aid virus segal discus finding gonda et al compared hiv visna closelyrelated virus found visna virus similar hiv two fact identical according finding hahn group mutation rate hiv virus million time higher similar virus average alteration took place every two year would mean difference hiv visna would  zero  mean  say segal  time visna virus changed hiv receiving time ability become parasite human tcells high genetic instability known retrovirus also consistent fact first case aid appeared one year later spring   comparison genome visna hiv  add segal  coffin hit upon remarkable feature env envelope area hiv genome encodes envelope protein help virus attach host cell nucleotide longer area visna behavior suggests additional piece inserted genome visna virus piece alters envelope protein enables bind treceptors section behaves like biologically alien body match rest system biochemically emphasis mine mentioned work gonda et al show hiv virus section nucleotide exist visna virus length corresponds coffin described section particularly unstable indicates alien object according segal  originates htlv genome discovered galloed likelihood accidental occurrence hiv genome sequence identical section htlv nucleotide length zero  since visna virus incapable attaching human receptor must transfer htlv genome section gave visna capability word addition htlv visna made hiv virus addition high mutation rate hiv genome explained another scientific team chandra et al fact  combination two genome part alien artificial mean rather natural process evolution process would immediately eliminated natural selection system replete disorder   fact case  say segal  hiv essentially visna virus carry additional protein monomer htlv epitope capable bonding receptor neither alizon montagnier biologist know natural mechanism would make possible epitope transferred htlv visna virus reason come one conclusion gene combination arose artificial mean gene manipulation  construction hiv  construction recombinant virus mean gene manipulation extraordinarily expensive requires large number highly qualified personnel complicated equipment expensive high security laboratory moreover product would commercial value  ask segal  would provided resource type research aimed solely production new disease would deadly human being  english sociologist allistair hay well paxman et al  higher form killing  ed published document whose authenticity confirmed u congress showing representative pentagon requested additional funding biological warfare research intention create within next ten year new virus would susceptible immune system afflicted patient would able develop defense ten year later spring first case aid appeared new york  thus began phase frantic experimentation  say segal one group working trying cause animal pathogen adapt life human being done cover searching cure cancer race gallo described finding year later gallo described gene manipulation conducting published discovery htlv fall p highest security category laboratory human pathogen subjected genetic manipulation laboratory officially opened building fort detrick md pentagon main biological warfare research center  article der spiegel prof mollings point type gene manipulation still extremely difficult one would genius great robert gallo purpose note segal  lo behold supposed compliance international accord banning research production storage biological weapon part fort detrick  demilitarized  virus section renamed  frederick cancer research facility  put direction cancer research institute neighboring bethesda whose director robert gallo happened year gallo discovered htlv explaining virus escaped segal note u biological agent traditionally tested prisoner incarcerated long period promised freedom survive test however initial hiv infection symptom mild followed seemingly healthy patient  conducted research must concluded new virus  virulent could considered military use test patient seemingly recovered given freedom patient professional criminal new york city relatively close offered suitable milieu moreover patient exclusively men many history homosexuality drug abuse often case american prison understandable aid broke precisely precisely among men among drug user precisely new york city  assert segal go explain whereas case infection mean sexual contact incubation period two year case massive infection via blood transfusion must case prisoner incubation period shorter year  thus new virus ready beginning experiment began without much delay first case full blown aid exactly result could expected  next three lengthy chapter segal examine
