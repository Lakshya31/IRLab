block allows data error escape detection crc  really sound like mr forsburg read documentation page description ymodem batch give detailed example mix byte packet becoming silly mr forsburg expect taken seriously one change size packet acked shift smaller packet outstanding packet finally acked suggest otherwise foolish word fact well recognized field smaller packet better chance noisy line didactic empirical  paul meiners  intriguing comment zmodem slow come great surprise zcomm proyam user routinely get throughput better bps transferring file pcxt class machine unix telebit trailblazer modem user download file telegodzilla wretched thanks pnb phone line throughput character per second would join laughter  fact first series test ran zmodem disappointed performance obtained told expect transmission efficiency realizing test found slower expected certainly slower ymodem described king performance second tutorial produced many week later successful new test obtained working efficient version dszexe pointed zmodem indeed fast though still fast ymodem  james davis   unfortunately u telebit trailblazer simple fact mr forsburg measure performance number byte sent tube unit time misleading performance measured  gt powercomm  taken dividing size file time transmission take account cost overhead like escaped control character mr forsburg would u believe escaped control character effect performance know better pay phone bill  paul meiners  gttutor claim zmodem slow especially puzzling later claim zmodem fails operate bps buffered modem fast protocol slow fast relevant word nt  slow   fast   bogus   mr forsburg continues display misunderstanding zmodem transmits byte fast never claim contrary merely transmits file slowly protocol us escaped character transmits file slowly optimized protocol example sealink better performance rating zmodem escape control character  paul meiners  gttutor state zmodem us byte block actuality zmodem us variable subpacket length byte zmodem data frame encompass entire file  mr davis misunderstood forgivable considering complexity mr forsburg documentation byzantine kind characterization  paul meiners  davis mention zmodem  protocol written program like gt  considering little davis understands zmodem indeed fortunate  restate would much like zmodem internal gt find lack required time accomplish task largely due byzantine nature mr forsburg documentation fine protocol suffers verbose documentation  paul meiners  davis mention twice called  powercomm   procomm  documentation contemplates embarrassed would documentation released way took polytron powercom trademark doubled   letter called program  name product  gt powercomm  mr davis mine  paul meiners  mentioning sealink becoming popular opus bb system support gttutor fails mention opus support zmodem well  new version opus writing still beta test support zmodem much better protocol sealink happy see happen wish everyone supported zmodem  paul meiners  gttutor complains zmodem requires ten ctrlx row abort transfer many observation file observation wide mark zmodem requires five davis read zmodem protocol description flaming would noticed comment zmodem originally required two ctrlx row abort changed five several transfer failed line noise generated two ctrlx character row  absolutely honest dsz get change often impossible keep many bb run dsz warn use  ten ctrlx cancel   changed incorrect apologize  paul meiners  gttutor claim  network friendly zmodem bother nt escape coding anything probably fatal mistake future particularly network get crowded  comment make one wonder author ever read zmodem protocol description except perhaps brain damaged drug intoxication reality little gttutor world zmodem escape network control character used major psvans option escape control character  powercomm  megalink protocol implemented according april document much le network friendly zmodem  drivel zmodem obviously network friendly get idea claimed otherwise beneath comment  paul meiners   opening comment pointed inadvertantly described sealink network friendly zmodem mr meiners made comment apparantly seen particular tutorial error correct  james davis  gttutor close section high speed bps modem come surprise davis still hate zmodem bothering set dsz modem use flow control method remember zmodem protocol slow slow modem told  get idea mr davis  hate zmodem  could truth mr davis greatest respect zmodem although respect mr forsburg slipping little right remember mr davis even talked continuing support zmodem threatened drop due mr forsburg incessant release dsz nt even version number dsz us date version number kind make life hard developer trying keep zmodem fine protocol premier protocol field today nobody hate weird idea  paul meiners  think tutorial data communication might mentioned two method flow control tutorial might mentioned mean practical term example hardware flow control lock communication unless cabling exactly correct usually nt proyam zcomm dsz network modem default software flow control test nobody bothered use default  note cabling correct sure lot lot trouble beyond simple problem flow control modem user better make sure cable modem installed correctly end problem result otherwise geez thought everyone knew substitute proper installation  paul meiners  updated version speed using bps transmission zmodem test using trailblazer modem bps interface speed better result obtained bps zmodem result show byte ascii file transferred phone line ibm pc xt class hard disk wxmodem  efficiency cps sealink  cps ymodem  cps megalink  cps  zmodem  cps  additional test impossible also meaningless mr forsberg use exact hardware controlled environment end worst could possibly sent file sent test ran read tutorial know every file unique performance network friendly protocol variable number byte may need escape coded file size affect significantly overhead factor total transfer efficiency mr forsberg could easily said zmodem developed performance cps would credible finally claim sent ascii file  byte used  byte arced file order eliminate hardware compression efficiency intelligent modem capable providing test may well indicated modem quite efficient say nothing zmodem relative protocol  james davis  contrary gttutor earlier claim zmodem lethargy dsz xt let alone fast enough overdrive high speed modem flow control mismatched dsz zcomm proyam powercom default xonxoff flow control telebit trailblazer many buffered modem work properly even using bps interface speed bps modem connection zmodem program used trailblazer fastcomm mnp data race buffered modem fact proyam experience high speed modem extensive proyam includes special code work around subtle firmware bug modem  first megalink support form flow control second many circumstance require form control used simultaneously megalink support well whole issue flow control  red herring  mr forsburg part beginning take document seriously  paul meiners  megalink megalink claimed fast inexpensive reliable file transfer protocol  claimed goal let others describe whether attained goal somewhat modest mr forsburg  paul meiners  megalink description identifies zmodem ideal protocol fast reliable expensive ie non trivial implement zmodem protocol software available public domain c source code since problem porting zmodem new system arise concurrency data transmission compiler bug affecting crc calculation megalink offer advantage unless one compiler turbo pascal turbo c bought le  big deal already  several  big deal  first mr forsburg deny zmodem non trivial implement indeed  big deal  one goal pd protocol designer way back ward christiansen simplicity design second  big deal  world begin end c quite language seems mr forsburg rather pompous considering zmodem written coded c  paul meiners  megalink claim use jennings telink header block format header block described actually resembles sealink header block different incompatible telink header  megalink use telink header block sealink way simply misstatement fact mr forsburg  paul meiners  developer megalink read zmodem protocol description carefully would repeated many design error previous protocol identified zmodem document  mr forsburg considers design error prefer call simplification  paul meiners  addition repeating many mistake identified avoided design zmodem megalink author make number false statement zmodem  could thing ever said zmodem fine protocol rather difficult implement  paul meiners  megalink offer advantage well designed zmodem protocol except vehicle hype  powercomm  program  gave mr forsburg due fact remains neither zmodem megalink easy implement ask john friel author qmodem megalink offer distinct advantage implementor offer structure based packet structure author done xmodem feel comfortable obviously mr forsburg different opinion zmodem primary asset dsz excellent implementation difficult protocol zmodem made difficult mr forsburg steadfast refusal stop fiddling fact documentation verbose verbose indeed easy miss point  paul meiners  filling disk
