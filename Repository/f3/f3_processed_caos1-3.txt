involved playtesting successor stormbringer elric willing answer simple question system attempt indicate major difference earlier system uninitiated chaosium decided discontinue stormbringer replacing line elric clearly related game heard number possible reason change convincing seems dissatisfaction way stormbringer treated moorcock world magic general elric seems lynn willis gather primarily responsible rule attempted create simple game epic hero epic hero nature game might distinguishing factor sure starting character offered sizeable number point spread around skill pretty much feel might allow one create unbalanced character allow concentrate great extent certain area even excel first character example rapier skill would pretty incredible starting stormbringer character change may appear cosmetic mean ca nt gm make change course game thing seem unbalanced think lot effect overall genre game biggest critizisms remember stormbringer fragile character one hit flew apart game seemed encourage saga heroic revised system seems favor thing starting character creation compared detail damage weapon seems elric increased protection afforded armor possibly increased lifespan character magic interesting change magic stormbringer limited strange practioners elric set almost runequestlike spell available character spell taken character creation however clock  chaos  point

made good selection effect ranging fairly standard combat spell spell enhance characteristic allow interaction force favorite spell allows take appearance another person roleplaying us spell endless indeed selection spell would seem encourage roleplaying rather simple combat overall system seems lot like chaosium system skill percentile based characteristic familiar x roll  active  characteristic including useful dexterity dexx see used time skill list seems well chosen allowing wide selection skill without lot useless choice interesting category opinion art category amongst suggested art art conversation others useful interesting final moment word character part character creation process way contained single page rule fine innovation selection demeanour may term wrong general attitude crafty skilled active knowledgeable memory attitude give basic set bonus skill work feel really help initial creation character working attitude possibly suggested occupation homeland quite easy create character rapidly maybe simple crutch think powerful one heard people bit restless stormbringer elric material taking long time hit shelf know fact material high quality delay due desire produce material new system rather publishing another supplement old redundant system know release date think worth wait hopefully generate discussion maybe want know elric maybe thing stormbringer
