judicial acceptance dna profiling john sylvester jd john h stafford jd special agent dna task force legal counsel division federal bureau investigation washington dc forensic dna profiling intense judicial scrutiny court year even overwhelming majority court admitted forensic dna evidence reviewing varying standard traditionally afforded novel scientific evidence court recognized numerous decision genetic profile developed individual dna reliable probative objective however despite many favorable decision dna evidence challenged must continue undergo pretrial review least court appeal jurisdiction evidence offered address question whether dna evidence acceptable hearing challenge evidence place issue ability forensic laboratory match similar dna profile reliably thereafter ability

potential unfair prejudice reliability offered testimony general acceptance technique scientific community factor determining admissibility new scientific evidence overriding concern standard example evidence may rejected relevancy standard jury asked accept expert bare assertion faith alone dna profiling autoradiogram produce permanent record result procedure available review defendant jury danger jury asked accept scientific opinion faith alone thereby minimized  castro  standard recently new york trial court  people  v  castro  expanded traditional approach review dna evidence determining forensic dna profiling met standard established  frye  court established new precedent admissibility dna profiling evidence determine whether dna profiling technique generally accepted also determine whether technique properly applied specific case court defendant castro accused murder investigation investigator obtained speck blood suspect watch subsequent dna analysis performed private laboratory associated blood victim however defense expert disputed laboratory interpretation test result contending profile uninterpretable inconclusive court became convinced private laboratory properly apply accepted technique dna profiling case excluded evidence match use trial interestingly defendant ultimately pled guilty admitting blood watch band victim court followed approach  castro  party introducing dna evidence standard must demonstrate pretrial hearing laboratory properly performed accepted scientific technique analyzing forensic sample particular case judicial acceptance forensic dna profiling reviewed extensively court varying standard afforded novel scientific evidence number favorable decision encouraging overwhelming majority court admitted

admission trial separate admissibility hearing state moreover appellate level court including eight state court last resort reported favorable decision reviewing dna profiling varying standard review recently however single state appellate court balked recognizing dna profiling left door open future admission  commonwealth  v  curnin  supreme judicial court massachusetts reversed trial court admission dna evidence analyzed private laboratory court observed offer population statistic convey jury common rare reported dna profile u population supported testimony expert population genetics

estimating probability match would randomly encountered caucasian population united state u district court northern district ohio subsequently adopted magistrate recommendation recognizing reliability evidence several state also recognized inherent reliability probative value forensic dna evidence passed statute deeming admissible criminal prosecution defense challenge admissibility major defense challenge mounting duration magnitude defense attorney seek counter potential impact jury forensic dna profiling challenge focus bias matching population statistic bias defense expert contend forensic test biased suspect since examiner aware sample contributor expects match however fact fbi dna test result actually exclude named suspect onethird submitted case often traditional serological examination included suspect potential source sample statistic similar reported laboratory performing forensic dna analysis matching expert defense still challenge ability forensic dna laboratory determine reliably match given deteriorated degraded condition forensic sample contend degraded sample cause marker shift processing sample unknown degree possibly resulting false matching sample court however found criticism valid population statistic principle focus current attack population statistic reported laboratory match established current application technology yet exclude one profile every person world dna profiling laboratory sample portion population determine common rare certain dna profile occur population data laboratory develops statistical estimate frequently particular dna profile likely appear u population scientist testified fbi sufficiently addressed difference among ethnic subpopulation within race therefore properly ass resultant effect upon statistical calculation provided match however two trial court accepted opinion expert fbi laboratory case representative significant part scientific community therefore rejected population data estimate provided fbi however objection expected persist great majority court reviewing dna profiling evidence differing standard review considered challenge forensic dna profiling recognize technique reliable generally accepted scientific community moreover scientific community fbi laboratory developed continue develop data directly responsive issue raised pretrial hearing information continues disseminated appropriate community scientist information disseminated fully consensus community manifestly apparent favor fbi laboratory conservative use population statistic dna profiling investigative consideration dna profiling fast gaining acceptance court investigator mindful forensic dna evidence yet positively identify depositor biological sample one factor identification relied upon alone support determination innocence guilt given current state technology forensic dna analysis limited determining whether known biological sample individual genetically similar questioned biological sample moreover relevance match exclusion varies depending circumstance case example statistical probability arrived examining laboratory ie odds someone defendant contributor sample particular case jury informed dna profile match defendant fairly common sampled community inference someone defendant even small community could contributor sample therefore association suspect crime scene sample strong statistic indicate profile rare accordingly investigator discount need traditional investigation support case prosecution also investigator must aware limitation dna analysis impact decision whether person excluded suspect crime example woman raped semen recovered suppose dna profile semen recovered match dna profile suspect suspect exonerated perhaps consider example victim may recent consensual sexual relation husband boyfriend rape occurred husband boyfriend victim may sole contributor sample taken victim immediately rape person responsible rape contribute semen sample evidentiary value consequently forensic dna profile match suspect profile absence suspect dna exclude suspect accordingly additional nondna evidence give investigator cause believe particular suspect responsible crime despite dna test result suggest exclusion suspect essential investigator determine whether victim consensual sexual relation rape occurred dna sample obtained person comparison forensic sample match forensic profile husband andor boyfriend profile indicates dna person believed responsible crime recovered victim follows principal suspect exonerated one committed crime basis dna test result conclusion exception federal state court throughout united state overwhelmingly admitted dna test result regardless admissibility standard used particular jurisdiction rflp restriction fragment length polymorphism technique along newly emerging dna technology already begun revolutionize personal identification criminal case court continue recognize reliability probative value dna evidence public benefit greatly increased efficiency criminal investigation trial point distant future dna evidence routinely admitted criminal trial become common use fingerprint moreover
