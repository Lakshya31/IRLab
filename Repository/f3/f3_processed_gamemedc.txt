make selection note way ibm designed parallel prot highest bit bit input inverted  building cartridge reader sure use hct family equivalent purchasing part hct family mean chip  high speed  cmos level output ttl level input either print pcb pattern provided wire wrap circuit another option use breadboard must careful breadboard project tend loosen wire period time filename schematic readsch

use volt source inside pc first part fairly easily obtainable nt good electronics store area mail order part digikey call ask catalog pin card edge connector fairly hard find make item ribbon cable variant use connector ribbon cable put dip plug end ribbon decide sure keep ribbon cable short ie inch le cut noise using connector shave edge order get fit genesis cartridge ca nt find pin connector get pin connector insert barrier key separate pin cut extra pin capacitor go  ground put one near possible chip keep connection ibm pc parallel port cartridge reader short possible reduce noise factor  software program written c compiled using borland cc need convert microcrud c zortech whatever else change outport inport function call whatever compiler us software provided readcartc testcartc sizetestc readcartc read data cartridge writes specified file file specification given write gamedat must also specify size file megabit program hard coded read data lpt use another parallel port sure change address macro definition testcartc program test cartridge reader feed lower bit address back data line program verify correct operation cartridge reader sizetestc program automatically determine size megabit cartridge plugged cartridge reader  testing debugging hook address line data line go go etc run testcartc program get consistent error wiring problem forgot hook  volt power source get random error noise problem shorten cable cartridge reader compuer reader add capacitor power source still get noise error play delay factor line testcartc andor add pullup pulldown resistor line going parallel port feel confident everything working plug cartridge read two three time compare file get make sure noise problem offset f hex contain ascii info whatever cartridge plugged nt try another cartridge say something like sega genesis c sega feb sonic hedgehog etc almost sega produced game say sega genesis offset hex appears byte order switched ie come esagg nesesi something like four wire hct hct switched around ca nt find text offset hex try looking hex hex find one location wire going hct hct switched around playing back read order play back read cartridge need store either static ram eprom flash memory going store eprom flash memory need eprom programmer needham electronics sell nice one cheap flash memory especially nice since erase electronically like static ram nonvolatile like eprom program fast unfortunately hard find microprocessor unlimited ask price sheet sell intel f flash memory well eprom static ram f megabit chip bit wide need two eprom highest density hardest program pain erase put ultraviolet lamp last time checked static ram come megabit configuration provide sort battery backup transferring program ibm pc genesis easiest way make carrier memory chip get cartridge already two bit wide chip hack apart early electronics art game use arrangement clip leg chip desolder one one replace chip zif zero insertion force socket larger zif socket

nt much anything super nintendo detect presence lockout chip properly connected super nintendo read cartridge wo nt may want use pullup resistor tie inputsoutputs lockout chip high nt leave anything floating read cartridge cartridge connector inside super nintendo console consists connector  inch wide using  inch contact center pin total pin either side separated pin center width connector roughly pin solder tail connector use one pair barrier key center cartridge finger looking super nintendo front console connector pin towards front numbered left right connector pin towards rear
