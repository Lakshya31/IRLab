depth starting   statement chapter   statement chapter statement use capital letter show reserved word capitalize program remember c casesensitive language puke capitalize statement called  selection  statement  conditional  statement basically test operation value determine whether true false c something equal logical false zero anything zero considered true value logical      true false  true  true basic syntax statement condition statement example following statement print  yes  variable x equal x printf  yes  oops forgot  conditional operator  brings u another topic need cover conditional operator follows operator operation          equal equal le greater le equal greater equal background mathematics easily grasp meaning operator however confuse equality operator  assignment operator  completely different us example x assigns value variable x whereas x  test see x equal may seem bit confusing get hang many yes many compiler warning  possible incorrect assignment  statement turbo c borland c compiler catch instance may improperly used two operator note used pascal modula equality operator language  assignment operator c whereas assignment operator pascal modula c plain  nt get confused find sometimes sitting write modula using  place drill head assignment equality  ok back statement best way learn always say look study example put example let see produce printf  true  statement  true  never print conditional statement    greater  evaluated false printf statement never execute printf  true  example  true  print indeed greater  printf  true   true  print greater equal  printf  true  example put anything inside conditional statement remember anything zero equivalent logical false everything else considered true case conditional statement zero henceforth true example  true  print printf  true  introduce another new symbol logical symbol negate expression including symbol touched earlier equal operator expression logical evaluation               false true  true true false  false example evaluated equal   false  true  print seems confusing read ha ha ha  seriously though come remember nt necessarily mathematical expression inside parenthesis conditional

tell user whether number equal zero  zero  include stdioh void main void int printf  input number  scanf   printf  number zero   printf  number zero  ok functional program world work first message prompt user input number scanf function read number keyboard address variable need review scanf value checked see whether equal zero first message printed zero second message printed note never case message print ever case neither message printed one one message always printed one way could represented conditional statement would test logical value variable follows printf  number zero  printf  number zero  remember logically false zero powerful aspect c see us later  else seems kind redundant check value twice doesnt c major programming language else statement syntax condition statement else statement basically condition evaluated true statement executed otherwise else statement executed statement single statement entire code block learned chapter expand syntax condition statement else statement much functional singleline statement let take quick look else statement see figure following program  negative  include stdioh void main void int printf  input number  scanf   printf  negative number  else printf  negative number  simple enough right evaluated le zero first message printed else second message printed method save u check value large program greatly effect execution

many prediction made ai expert marvin minsky made great pronouncement come nottoodistant future ai juicedup making computer could play chess well thought  well computer play chess par normal human nt far away simple thing like language translation computer seeing object computer thinking etc etc  learned lot thing seemed simple first nt simple lot ambiguous thing world simple example language translation seems like something computer almost perfectly designed give vast dictionary english russian able translate back forth ease nt work way take english sentence  spirit willing flesh weak  translated early computer designed translation came russian  vodka good meat rotten  occurred meaning attach word  spirit  mean  alcoholic beverage  could also mean  ghost   soul   good feeling  etc bit small problem thing like beginning solved needed translator understood would translate still bit pipe dream even gotten better choosing right method though however one area ai come forward
