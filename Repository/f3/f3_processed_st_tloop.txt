tashas alive time living seperate life nt mean constantly mucking history simply two seperate people maybe dna structure think clone like history nt even changed history always like first season saw real tasha walking alternative tasha around well nt see clarify point let look enterprisec history ec start real timeline get transported wormhole alternative timeline event yesterday enterprise occur alternative tasha decides go back ec return real timeline get captured romulans problem wormhole  real  timeline crew saw right beginning yesterday enterprise according chart nothing special happens point real timeline theory wormhole happened occur time real timeline alterantive one real guinan somehow projected conciousness wormhole purpose alternative guinan making believe everything wrong happened time ec came third try explanation batemanc pcsmanacuk ama three timeline involved two first timeline trek timeline prior ye norm timeline enterprisec destroyed everything proceeds normally however something interacts superstring create temporal rift rift extends back event enterprisec battling romulans creates new timeline alternate time line timeline high energy interaction superstring material quoth raven  throw enterprisec subjective present bang new timeline alternate time line timeline caused entc past militaristic timeline ye timeline entc sent back tasha yar board timeline episode ye onwards set allowing u explain number trek inconsistancies butterfly effect provided insonsistancies occur pre post ye episode important bit one timeline active believe star trek time intended function reason wormhole norm creates destroys norm create recreates destroys shrewd among may point hence two different intent purpose equivalent guinan sens extend across time space hence realise timeline wrong timeline war occured sela appears fourth try explanation robinson elux csumassedu explanation valid imho though comforting start journey timeline common normal alternate timeline enterprisec route narendra iii response distress call four romulan warbirds ambush fight ensues fight creates temporal rift future believe data attributed massive discharge weapon probably romulans enterprisec flees effect time travel forward year continue federation klingons going war forth correct time line timeline tasha yar die enterprised find rift year later enterprisec come time guinan see beyond linear time see picard send enterprisec back time changed two timeline mind assume appears presence temporal rift somehow activates sense race see timeline far preferable naturally assumes correct timeline really alternate timeline explains waited inform picard everything wrong nothing wrong least rift showed allowing enterprisec go back history change time enterprisec time travel back rift thus altering time creating alternate timeline two tasha yars timeline two tasha way connected far universe concerned matter regardless meaning assign matter call chunk tasha yar one tasha enterprisec captured daughter dy always case never knew capture enterprisec might also explain romulans able catch technology phasers photon torpedo etc second tasha life normal life dy hand armus thus valid timeline one fed klingons war last comment want make enterprised seeing rift peaceful timeline logical mistake shown otherwise everyone would confused ok likely writer confused guess problem writer little technical background already knew since rift exist past ie created action battle action enterprised year later always existed normal timeline enterprisec showed destroyed caused
