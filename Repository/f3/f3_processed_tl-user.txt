toneloc v user manual minor threat mucho maas toneloc short tone locator bit wild thing simple dial number looking kind tone also look carrier like ordinary wardialer useful finding pbx finding loop milliwatt test number finding dialup long distance carrier finding number give constant tone something modem recognize one finding carrier modem hacking pbx even start using toneloc please please take time print read doc well nt print least read toneloc extremely flexible configured work almost modem almost environment extensively tested everything generic usr k duals unfortunately flexibility

probably sort detail get little confusing little detail order several way deal ringing message modem generate simplest simply disable x command modem init string x ringing voice supressed response simple enough wo nt get much diagnostic detail log dat file scan take longer call go way timeout instead aborting earlier ringout voice response enable message x flag respond voice ringing detected unfortunately usr applecat voice give false response looking dialtones particular importance high pitched tone hz aka winkstart precedes many pbx initial dialtone cause voice response x supresses voice response leaf ringing response experience ringing seldom false response potential voice response show busy decide use x youll need adjust maxrings parameter config file experiment little bit decide set set number ring recorded toneloc never abort ring using usrobotics modem scan carrier however use x command since modem never give false response looking carrier scan go faster dat file detailed scan        well dial tone fuck first figure kind number pbx usually  digit code longer code enter correct code hear second dial tone otherwise probably get reorder fast busy busy hangup ringing sometimes ring pbx attendant operator ugh ringing attendant good way find owns pbx get second dialtone dial acn sometimes xacn x often le frequently digit make long distance call note acn area code number pbx code need dial sometimes code follow number format acncode sometimes need dial first many also call international experiment see hacking might also longdistance extender dialup find many prefix xxxx sometimes easy hack code please careful easy get busted mci people dick get busting people announcing world sprint nt fuck around either bust like keep quiet little guy getting smarter consult local phreaks experimenting unfamiliar extender tip scan find give either result voice ring busy tone also timeouts investigate may find something interesting like voiceprompted dialup modem carrier may also find  phantom  mucho area several mci dialup port longer use since full implementation equal access hack day wo nt find code try figure hacking waste time dead end explanation loop tell know ai nt whole lot loop pair phone number usually consecutive like   used phone company testing good loop u well cool way simple use loop loop two end high end low end one end give usually constant loud tone called end silent loop nt usually ring either end called people called end talk loop loop voice filtered wo nt pas anything constant tone nt much use use working loop billing phone call first call end give loud tone operator someone call end tone go quiet act like phone rang answered  say  hello   allo   chow   yo  fuck ever operator think called phone bill go loop local rboc get bill use technique moderation loop may go loop probably useful want talk someone nt want give phone number carrier well would hope know carrier nt good place start mentor guide hacking phrack forget issue tonemap something new             first wrote ran tonemap amazed saw tonemap read toneloc dat file display data visually screen big deal right actually useful saw scattered color saw definate pattern within prefix scanned hopefully took time print doc file going go one example dat file run tonemap like  tonemap xxxx  press enter youll need vga see square color take  screen key

timeout orangered busy number dark blue blacklisted number dark green ringout rang many time light green tone light yellow carrier cyan noted number n pressed dark red aborted spacebar pressed color see key one important one unless colorblind probably already noticed pattern prefix vertical band middle prefix  fact one entire column busy number use cursor key move white cursor around map number bottom right corner change see result type color number get little lot dat map exchange rural residential one probably see even distribution result code certain level major result code besides different number timeouts ringouts busys residential exchange look similar even distribution pattern business exchange much likely find pattern may find string cluster modem large range similar timeouts voice response etc range busy like column example could permanently busy message modem detects busy series ringouts could indicate part pbx direct inward dial group varies widely best bet always check manually never know youll find behooves scan prefix study result best scan prefix one big scan xxxx rather xxx xxx etc see whole prefix would love look result look dat file try get touch u know  maybe tonemap end tshirt someday hacking pbx        pbx code digit le use toneloc hack simplest way use toneloc look internal dialtone let say found digit pbx  hang enter bad code use toneloc like toneloc example mwxxx exampledat dat file specifies mask produce dialing string like atdt wxxx w toneloc dial number wait dialtone try code wait second dialtone get right code get second dialtone otherwise get timeout pbx alert tone invalid code w command hear dialtone ca nt look second dialtone directly w command pbx toneloc scan mode designed specifically problem set scan mode look everything except tone either config file command line use toneloc like toneloc example mwxxxw produce dialing string like atdt wxxxw w toneloc dial number wait first dialtone dial code wait dialtone dial wait dialtone code invalid second w command hear alert tone dialtone dial tone keep playing third w respond alert tone giving final response tone code valid second w command hear internal dialtone immediately quiet since xx xxx valid extension pbx would give final response timeout since third w command wo nt find tone voila code confused yet method might work xx xxx nt valid extension pbx trying hack since pbx immediately give alert tone dial first digit invalid extension fail first time around think might problem look phone number pbx indial example pbx indial  good bet valid extension near xxx xx x therefore probably going first digit valid extension making good candidate terminal digit apparently pbx respond carrier blast invalid code although never found one use everythingbutacarrier scan mode look internal dialtone carrier nt appear tone w command see dual scanning caution usage note            personal experience scanning  exchange toneloc recommend exercise caution classic example see fall issue magazine letter minor threat received dialing  number hand sequentially first looking tone may get much many pbx extenders would looking answer short tone length ring toneloc perceive tone ring many pbx may also answer silence need activate tone local pbx answer like well however exchange likely better security since constant pressure callsell operation well every code abuser nation second mci sprint get irritated someone make thousand call exchange unlike local number easy access least area code exchange probably entire phone number since call cost somebody money nt conducting legitimate business call might also considered theft service hacking system kind computer long distance extender pbx even vmb system extremely risky urge use good judgment find local pbx divert call live area call return call trace caller id active definitely experience call return toneloc politely explain anyone call back dialed wrong number nt provoke call trace know may even meet fellow hacker happened u twice caller id active use caution could phone number scanning could construed harrassment especially happens  case please use intelligence scanning range belongs large company often operator answer dozen incoming phone number strange hangups may get tiresome enough course day might decide something listen toneloc figure kind exchange scanning principally business exchange consider scanning night affected business closed mostly residential might want scan day make intelligent use exclude mask eliminate range likely unproductive unused range pager number answering service cellular phone etc want overview local exchange first try yellow page quickly discover promising exchange want greater depth go local public library ask reference desk crisscross directory section directory listing telephone number exchange list unlisted nonpublished number pbx show although pbx billing number might show exchange residential one ten minute thought save hour scanning hacking pbx sense late night nobody using pbx little patience glad make sure hack randomly sequential hacking always good way get noticed although probably wo nt make difference case besides toneloc better chance finding code sooner scanning illegal care           nt know heard legal scan business hour call would harrasment heard illegal call heard scanning intent hack illegal thing could proven people suggest using phone line hacking scanning remember important thing whether illegal whether piss someone attract attention staff magazine say wardialing  place scanning made illegal would hard though someone file complaint scanning since whole purpose call every number likely thought harassment anyone get single phone call scanning computer central office known react strangely people start scanning sometimes unable get dialtone hour start scanning uniform policy best thing first find got crazy law saying ca nt likely law way find happens give try
