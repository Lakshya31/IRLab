service getting dangerous even relatively safe one like metrofone allnet beginning trace bust people fraudulantly use service however luckily another safer way local wats pbx modem interface computer capable tone dial ing find make good use great many  useful  number nt hardware still possible although would tedious process pbx private branch exchange private switchboard set office building hotel etc allows people within pbx dial exchange directly place going call interested sometimes transmit voice ver intercom system lot phun least line going pbx telco set outgoing call also least one incoming line switchboard interested incoming line always answered switchboard operator answered pbx equipmemt usually answer dialtone tone sound different different system even answer synthesized voice hard find though one answer dialtone easy find modem hardware device  hear  going phone line find fun thingies write scanner program dial number pre fix either sequentially random order really nt matter  listen  line constant sound longer normal length ring could done manually would take hell long time whenever program find number make constant tone longer ring record number array something number one thing noisy answering machine sprint mci etc access node person yell fone tone side loop nice possibly carrier modem  hear  tone high hopefully pbx line scanning done pm pm many number answered switchboard operator checking result next day come accross dialtone enter touchtone tm digit depending type pbx equipment length code  digit either give busy signal  reeler tone  highlow tone hang possibly tell entered bad code time write hacker pbx code digit likely one code digit may one hacker dial access number wait dialtone dial digit wait second dial   reason explained shortly  listen  dialtone would hacker system give reeler tone listening dial tone hearing would really mean presence reeler tone mean bad code entered reason entered  quiet  dialtone  good code xx xxx valid extentions practically pbx system give reorder hang bad code forget one listen dialtone good code digit tried sequen tiallly becuase probably one good one take pick random sequental finally get good code call number enter code confronted second dialtone exact dialtone anyone pick phone pbx system get reason important want make going call usually pick fone dial sometimes get another dialtone make call local long distance thing right number also make good tool avoid traced telenet etc traced back company owns pbx phun pbx broken dial extentions directly local pbx primarially used legitimately unless com pany outwats line phun extention pa system get pa intercom actutually talk house almost extention though may hunt used work mostly eliminated due phreakers people inside company figuring using pbx nt even security code call dial call wherever want know enter number code want know system  sound  like file system long list wats pbx number local one much safer hack though making whole bunch call tends get bell pissed also actually found modem wierd thing exchange pbx might worthwhile scan number inside pbx see find important safety note heavily abuse pbx make many outgoing call week whenever fone bill show good idea lay couple month could get trace easilly like usually change code though one interesing note found pbx direct link sprint dialing got line sprint access code
