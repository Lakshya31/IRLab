grammar spelling sent core material general comment                  greyhawk always kind flat  never seemed much good basis making campaign world lot idea decent framework knowing required greyhawk nt detailed forgotten realm new edition le support good medieval good v evil open feeling mean open mean many possibility grown greyhawk wide wild enough whatever want avoided ash wanted keep wide openeyed wonder think oerth greyhawk first sentimental favorite wasnt supported built upon much really kind bland many place result ash took standardissue world nt getting proper support gave real weight new lease life truly excellent work especially one add sargent subsequent effort  marklands   iuz evil  first nt bought much newer stuff  new improved  greyhawk creation tsr recently put well deserved death shame structure greyhawk nt left alone tsr could nt provide adventure said structure  instead create whole new world place silly adventure  original boxed set useful gave overall world place small kingdom point worldless spell st edition phb based creation wizard suppose living lived world greyhawk opportunity see lived early year player always made comment wish could play greyhawk gygax dm would cool hardcover bonus look could possibly accomplished lot hard work gave lot incentive try develop world better eventually gave decided would instead learn subtlety greyhawk better prepared surprise teleportation group player suddenly decided wanted see jungle chult valley mage  time tsr hinted going put gygaxs greyhawk ruin print module format kept saying would soon arrived  module greyhawk castle total waste precious game money totally depressed would even publish thing friendly store ownerinsideman said cheer put ruin looking one make dream drool  little faith making big cheat greyhawk castle tsr could even recover respect instead give one best thing ever payed money  ruin greyhawk great adventure started fall put campaign break last february year group character area greyhawk city greyhawk ruin base town zarnicus never able keep player getting  urge see side lake  syndrome module kept incredibly interested see  next level  ask player let know fun group character particular campaign nt get wrong believing nt campaign run occasionally least three long running campaign play started greyhawk ruin sort silently agreed put others hold sort silent consensus would still playing campaign actively today two player move town find work moved across continent remainder group find work get group together well certainly pick back finish even completed half think tsr put module market short period time really boned people missed encourage get hand  liked much bought another one print  would payed dealer known city greyhawk boxed set immense resource especially eversodifficult city campaings well thought thorough ash help transision war youre continuing thing went relatively similar happens  war  thing nt go provides lot idea possible plotlineseffects war carl sargent work uniformly excellent best material tsr ever put scope  ash  accompanying space restriction cramped style bit result still good real treat though recommend  marklands   iuz evil  carl enough room really shine   city skull  also excellent required reading anyone want incorporate truly evil realm campaign vividly convincingly fact sargent may little good city greyhawk boxed set wider collaboration also good even excellent value miniadventures vivid npc personality good  atmosphere  city complaint layoutmap gygax ten time better  gord rogue  book otherwise monstrous compendium appendix one best ratio useful monster silly one seen tsr supplement artwork good great though greyhawk adventure hardcover disappointment significant portion deity clerical sphere soon made useless contradictory update contrast forgotten realm handbook hardcover actually contained little information world greyhawk mostly compendium spell monster magic item  greyhawk war  outstanding history war game useless result product every greyhawk gamer shelf history  could   possessed many player rightly didnt want spend money game well nice going tsr carl sargent truly brilliant writer love stuff complete consistent true flavor greyhawk supplement well worth money greyhawk war one worst tsr produducts ever brought extremely low quality map little else promised much gave little greyhawk adventure hardcover somewhat useful lot good idea especially regard weird interesting geographic area new magic item monster seemed kinda stupid part city greyhawk boxed set welldone highly detailed look city greyhawk filled npc neat location rule city work  everything need detail city extensively needed thing could made better gygax helped write work gary gygax newer work carl sargent best quality content imeo marklands iuz evil great reference source excellent map show nt fit grand hex map campaign nt use gh war senario book still much invaluable wgr series      perhaps judging  rary traitor  unfairly due contrast sargent work still thought central storyline involving scorpioncrown insufficiently compelling npc rary robilar stature culture local tribe could also dealt much better comprehensively rary fortress way potential add fact important map missing supplement represents shining example gamers annoyed tsr city skull possibly favorite module published tsr intense youhavetogetinandoutdamn quickorelsethecavalryiscoming cavalry attitude tsr actually introduced new system workable made sense contributed game play notoriety point system get kudos book silly little candy bar either rary traitor although open whole new land somewhat dissapointing number clusterfcks made production resource page left area forgotten detail also nt really introduce anything new interesting rary tower kinda munchkiny good adventure surrounding desert wgr one best source ever seen tsr company alike fact probably use rolemaster never done thing greyhawk ruin module triple dungeon feel  old  tsr module place filled wide variety monster treasure trap  impressive piece work id buy module author principle alone wg series     get past silly plot senseless trap etc there fairtomiddling module hidden somewhere gargoyle unfortunately party time could nt find  maybe cause realm time run one  wg hillarious riot loved twisted level badly concealed pun blatant ripoff realized easy spoof  wg space taken monster description pc sheet story scanty material using show gargoyle rework would get lot wg many death save many prize wand force totally unbalanced item low level adventure wg ok later get hard fast  end
