use sound blaster gu together common question especially since gu claim sound blaster compatible gu sound blaster compatible use tsr word software simulation hardware since case many time game application work work fully adding sound blaster card gu card allows user take advantage sound card optimum sound case sound card used gu used music sound blaster used digitized sound   setting sound

know conflict fine use also irq q think used math coprocessor ie sx without math coprocessor trouble gu running program require do extender dosgw try gu irq setting le equal irq remember watch conflict card device trouble doom doom native gu mode try irq le irq free do going play game way sound blaster could either gu use diagnostics gu setup program determine hardware conflict e q nt gu setup program working order select setting mentioned advanced setup must selected allow choose setting need check hardware conflict                                        f q gu setup say sound

                                    g q set blaster environment variable autoexec wrong gu setup program assumes incorrectly using sound blaster emulation software come gu set set blaster variable

blaster pro would set blastera appropriate initilizations likewise regular sound blaster sure check make sure directory correct correct set blaster variable set since gu setup tends overwrite incorrect value q mix two sound output several option easiest run two separate output cord speaker work one sound input speaker altec lansing acoustic research computer speaker multiple input receiver also multiple input wish run sound stereo system one speaker input possible primitively mix two output using adapter found radio shack part number   however probably temporary solution ideal solution stereo line gu also routed stereo line input sound blaster allow output sound blaster carry mixed sound signal may fool mixer sound blaster pro get optimal result make sure cable use stereo   plug end especially routing sound blaster pro better reverse also true sound blaster line routed gu line sure enable l option q ultrinitexe l option megaem used turn line input gu mixing excessive noise coming gussound blaster using sound card possible sound blaster picking electrical noise computer case run ultrinit without l option turn line rerun ultrinit l option sound blaster sound needed suggested sound blaster pro better old gu revision  gu output routed sound blaster newer gu sound blaster routed gu best thing try way decide one give best sound   using sound blaster gu together  q card select

program music card digital effect card try use gu music sound blaster digital sound effect general midi roland sound canvas option choose gm sound canvas option roland mt lapc roland choose option
