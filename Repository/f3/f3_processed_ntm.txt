stretching rubber band rubber band ca nt stretched indefinitely tension increase rubber band stretched fact tension rubber band let go return original shape real rubber band ideal however elastic limit therefore break stretch far seen analogous ship torn apart exceeds warp capability special relativity time dialation galileo introduced principle relativity namely physic observer regardless relative speed turn century scientist proposed idea  ether  explain light could propagated vacuum thus introducing special frame reference experimental evidence speed light constant observer regardless relative speed albert einstein thus proposed special relativity theory observer nonaccelerating frame observe physic speed light observer latter principle implies one exceed speed light simply would perceive light travel normal speed thus  stationary  observer would see light travelling faster speed light order faster light travel must allow possibility light exceed speed light thus disposing principle principle disposed lightly light nothing time developing electromagnetic field electric field obeys formula e e      dt c dx c speed light thus c infinity light propagate thus c infinity reasonable suppose speed light subspace would warp  speed subspace radio let consider mean faster light travel would preserve principle relativity first let consider  relativistic effect  encountered travelling  relativistic  sublight speed mentioned section last formula sqrt vc time experienced observer time experienced passenger travelling velocity v relative observer example consider v  c day day effect known  time dialation  suppose one enter warp principle relativity implies one travelling particular speed one enters warp would imply existance special frame principle also implies one continues measure time exactly one one entered warp frame reference one one entered warp le important frame thus possibility two ship warp come different frame reference  phase  ship would consider passenger moving relatively slowly effect occurs course two ship travelling normal space relative velocity could many way problem may overcome simple would ship drop warp travel speed jason hinson successfully found one aspect theory immediately obvious namely theory make time travel possible way far plausible method used star trek imo consider possibility ship enters warp travel say warp say  hour drop warp increase speed mere  speed light new frame reference time first entered warp according formula ct ctvxc sqrt vc time event  hour future suppose reenter warp turn around see example tos  let last battlefield proceed warp back starting point trip take  hour end two identical ship place time one supposedly going leave  hour another already come back jason hinson hate

open many possibility suppose instance enterprise travel v  c case  year would pas planetside every year passed enterprise result people planetside would age rate faster people enterprise leon myerson pointed time dialation would social consequence example one describe old one time spent aboard ship planetside similarly one decide celebrate holiday like christmas one celebrate two three time year one board ship simply celebrated back earth time latter question may moot people decide amongst whether celebrate holiday former question important trekwise however people seen celebrating birthday birthday apparently seen accomplishment natural presume birthday count year individual actually aged people would determine old based amount time passed either board planetside one could well imagine

generalisation special relativity implication generalisation may status faster light travel got permission copy said article appears let u examine mean relativity isaac kuo quite rightly pointed relativity mean law physic frame basic principle physic would give fight come lorentz transformation lts crucial component special relativity show different coordinate frame transform position time

upon assumption speed light constant observer moving le c minkowski showed special relativity could recast geometrical form introducing called minkowski metric essentially contains two assumption einstein based special relativity upon minkowski defined interval d related coordinate x z d cdt dx dy dz lorentz transformation get importance fact preserve expression mathematically speaking make

spacetime exist frame respect signal travel backwards time sense physicist say ftl relativity lts time travel however end story reason twofold firstly nt give full picture going secondly live minkowski spacetime first point mention briefly consider following simple thought experiment let send b signal velocity u c let moving observer velocity v applying lorentz transformation situation see observer frame time signal sent time arrives given l v uvc l v vc   find v c event occur opposite order moving frame however full story ought also consider event moving observer measure actually tachyon experiment energy e moving frame energy e l v e uvc find frame energy measured negative tachyon charge e moving frame actually energy e thus moving frame actually appears happen b emits anti tachyon absorbs later time time order event reversed even event susharden use introduce called reinterpretation principle tachyons negative energy moving backwards time reinterpreted antitachyons moving forward time way hoped avoid causality paradox people put forward several author claim develop consstent theory tachyon kinematics using principle resolve tachyon paradox put forward work controversial personally sceptical worth noting people looking thing lot physic journal occasionaly carry paper subject second point made earlier interesting view actually live minowski spacetime curvature due gravity precisely curvature manifest gravity realm general relativity discussing note passing allow ftl signal itslef might imply spacetime even approximately minkowskian away source matter example source moving faster light observer moving le c might longer measure velocity c would invalidate special relativity would simply become special case wider theory possibilit however rather complicated general relativity general relativity replaces minkowski metrivc general object called metric tensor g b b usually written subscript famous einstein field equation relate einsten tensor g b stress energy tensor b contains information distribution energy matter einstein tensor built differentiating g b thus field equation g b pit b give differential equation g b general relativity ftl travel least mathematical possibility one write metric g allow peculiar behaviour example consider metric interval d given d cdt exp k r dr r dq sinqdw spherical polar coordinate extract information well one easy thing work radial velocity light set d  corresponds called null geodesic along light ray travel set q w constant get drdt  exp k r c exp exponential function thus radial speed light spacetime drdt exp k r c thus suitable choice k make light go faster c remember mathematical possiblity reason believe could find energy distribution real world solution einstein equation could could travel faster c  warped space  never faster light recently spacetime involving stable wormhole discovered kip thorne michael morris original paper appeared inthe american journal

impulse  finally leaving behind subject warp one thing want deal often quoted  full impulse  line used people helm increase speed one warp factor another impulse measure speed rather change momentum however one defines momentum warp clear one increase speed one increase momentum thus indeed change momentum thus impulse acceleration taken place given length time usage st tng therefore correct
