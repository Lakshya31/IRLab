recently begun investigate cannabis well according relman report two reason medical interest first cannabis exerts effect  mechanism differ available drug  secondly  since cannabis often work additive drug possible cannabis could combined drug achieve therapeutic goal drug used lower dose would required either used alone result fewer side effect would expected occur  experimentation promising
