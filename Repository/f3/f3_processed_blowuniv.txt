town get well intend use possible wear simple disguise hat sunglass possibly bandaid somewhere face distract people attention clothing would never normally wear go place homelessdownandout get clothing since getting supply need need throw clothing try use anything destroyed would give police clue nt use newspaper crumpled pipe keep thing place go kmart get cheapest quality paper available usually newsprint newpapers give police possible location date nt leave fingerprint anything wear glove whenever possible making mailingplacing device nt ever tell anybody working group prefer working alone nobody could snitch keep group small possible inform medium nt make sure tracable back never watch target target area mailingplacing device police often photograph mob case perpetrator watching action go medium video police often get copy see  perp  captured tape watching never go back scene look trace damage situation therefore looking trouble try make thing untracable whether writing source thing originated mail letter home town better drive mile mail also better mail item mail box larger town city rather actual post office letter look legitimate best put secondary target another university return address possible mail near city target see another institution le likely question also screw put insufficient postage package would get  returned  secondary target open get cheap scale weigh package flyer post office listing postal rate targetting  never hit exact target twice going pick institution leave time hit try make one bit different try pattern dont hit exact type office researcher time nt mail using type padded envelope use exact looking type mine nt mail city nt specific date day week season year even time day want leave pattern destruction police look never even suspect leave clue may already know target one way get caught target suspect situation must wait long time forgotten never suspected take year waited long year hit target situation course never approached suspect incidence never met target mean absolutely reason suspect see newspaper television go local university library look military medical engineering physic chemical journal see research dispicable project often visit university year hit write using fake name say interested possibly attending institution would like pamphlet even campus map bit disguise wander campus building going office noting office laboratory door ever get stopped campus security say lost looking admission office washroom go school hour many people around another nameless face go first week school year september many new student nt know way around campus common occurence people get lost nt note anything name seem interesting use imagination knowledge see door say  fluoroorganophosphate research  organofluorophosphate storage know research nerve gas artificial intelligence computer optical recognition laboratory also center military research look obvious signal sign saying  danger   caution   hazardous   radiation   biohazard  etc also see name room number note detail mailing address often also bulletin board listing senior member administration department note everything think might become target go retrainingwork counselling centre many sort literature various university list top people institution potential target bomb threat  nt believe either threat warning targetted mark intend hit consider something would add risk though done properly risk next zero united state bomb threat false could various reason wanting make bomb threat might left device want disrupt exam ceremony seminar etc often effective unless planted fake device suspicious looking package bag preferably set content viewed viewed containing pipe full sand matter weigh must look like could real bomb left device want damage property cause personal injury anyone want device found neither property damage injury want get medium attention cause scare prospective student away university maybe instead system want part want decrease number applying admission much better chance accepted two primary method making bomb threat writing telephone making bomb threat writing several concern never leave fingerprint anything even postage stamp leave trace saliva dna analysis licking either envelope shut stamp use water get common stationary available anywhere north america buy supply chain storesfranchises  kmart walmart use stationary purpose use  fresh  stationary police look imprint writing onto another piece paper top one nt give legitimate clue writing printing threat writing style different use typewriter help police reduce possible number suspect different model different type style age wear particular typewriter might identifiable peculiarity computer printer common tracable still make perpetrator someone access one thereby making police job little bit easier though much mail letter box good distance living give clue post office stamp cancellation mark thing date letter sent sorting station went send medium outlet maybe target send directly police nt send medium outlet even better newspaper television station probably never become public knowledge also sent police lot people handled making practically useless forensic purpose making threat telephone follow guideline leave useful clue use telephone would normally use even better use phone far away many mile would normally call payphones best familiar phone phreaking use diverter similar system make even harder authority track call originated leave fingerprint phone anywhere near never call police rehearse carefully intend saying information intend giving give information intended want know target bomb go want think planted mailed nt tell truth control decide information wo nt get make minor excursion planned nt worry long minor possible try seen telephone wear disguise leaving telephone hooded top hatscaps sunglass extra clothing make look larger useful driven telephone make sure parked good distance away license number connected person telephone making call assume may recorded disguise voice police ask whoever got message voice sounded like ש shrill hoarse ש person sound control agitated ש young old sounding ש noticable accent ש seem speech impediment keep message short simple nt let keep line tell say nt answer question preferably tell message first person get line nt let transfer anybody probably somebody familiar call likely taperecording call taking note security personel line police ask background noise receiver call heard provide false one take portable tape player speaker provide false clue could recorded music traffic noise subway rushhour crowd child playing school yard loud enough drown real background noise could clue calling yet loud completely drown message background noise also distract listener le likely note characteristic disguised voice give police clue erase tape finished electronic voice disguising equipment solve disguise problem found possession time also help make suspect guide specifically written bombing university used situation university inordinate influence society whether social class structure influencing control
