full dawn modern science tide ranked amongst greatest nature mystery indeed agency could invoked explain mysteriously regular flux reflux water ocean surprising steady rhythmical rise fall suggested imaginative mind breathing mighty animal even man first became aware fact regular movement somehow associated moon much nearer explanation bond could exist movement distant world diurnal variation water earth reported ancient astronomer despairing ever resolving mystery drowned sea earth pulled moon part merit newton mighty theory gravitation furnished explanation even ageold mystery see broad outline rate theory universal attraction applied case moon newton taught u pull every particle matter throughout earth imagine part earth surface comprises pacific ocean instance turned towards moon see moon pull acting loose mobile water would tend heap sort mound whole earth pulled moon water free obey pull solid earth although small tide also caused earth solid crust shown also corresponding hump would tend produced side earth owing case tendency water loosely connected lag behind solid earth earth surface entirely fluid rotation earth would give impression two hump continually travelling

observed phenomenon vastly complicated complete theory bear little resemblance simple form outlined everyone life neighbourhood port know instance high water seldom coincides time moon cross meridian may several hour early late high water london bridge instance occurs one half hour moon passed meridian dublin high water occurs one half hour moon cross meridian actually observed phenomenon far simple nevertheless completely worked time high water every port world prophesied considerable time ahead action sun moon would beyond scope attempt explain complete theory may mention one obvious factor must taken account since moon gravitational attraction produce tide expect sun whose gravitational attraction much stronger also produce tide would suppose first sight powerful tide moon true sun produce tide true powerful produced moon sun tideproducing power matter fact le half moon reason distance play enormous rôle production tide mass sun  time moon hand time far moon greater distance counterbalance greater mass result said moon twice powerful sometimes sun moon act together called spring tide sometimes act one another neap tide effect complicated number factor tide various place vary enormously thus st helena sea rise fall three foot whereas bay fundy rise fall fifty foot reason complicated  origin moon another aspect tide vastly greater interest importance theory discussing hand sir george h darwin son charles darwin tide made throw light evolution solar system particular illustrated origin development system formed earth moon quite certain long age ago earth rotating immensely faster moon near actually contact earth remote age moon point separating earth thrown earth earth moon one body high rate rotation caused body split two piece one piece became earth know became moon conclusion led examination tide first place let u consider energy produced tide see evidence energy round word coastline estuary scooped great rock gradually reduced rubble innumerable ton matter continually set movement whence energy derived energy like matter created nothing source make colossal expenditure possible earth slowing answer simple startling source tidal energy rotation earth massive bulk earth turning every twentyfour hour axis like gigantic flywheel virtue rotation posse enormous store energy even heaviest swiftest flywheel work even working friction bearing dispense energy ever must gradually slow escape reasoning rotation earth supply energy tide consequence tide must slowing earth tide act kind brake earth rotation mass water held back moon exert kind dragging effect rotating earth doubtless effect measured ordinary standard small however continuous course million year dealt astronomy small constant effect may produce considerable result another effect shown necessary mathematical consequence tidal action moon action earth produce tide also react moon tide slowing earth also driving moon farther farther away result strange may seem permit doubt result indubitable dynamical principle made clear without mathematical discussion interesting consequence follow since earth slowing follows rotating faster period long time ago day comprised twenty hour going farther back still come day ten hour inconceivable age ago earth must rotating axis period three four hour point let u stop inquire happening moon seen present moon getting farther farther away follows therefore day shorter moon nearer go farther back time find moon nearer nearer earth rotating faster faster reach period already mentioned period earth completed revolution three four hour find moon near almost grazing earth fact remarkable everybody know critical velocity rotating flywheel velocity beyond flywheel would fly piece centrifugal force developed great overcome cohesion molecule flywheel already likened earth flywheel traced history back point rotating immense velocity also seen moment moon barely separated earth conclusion irresistible age remote earth fly

increased greater rate day presently month became equal two day three calculated process went twentynine day month number day month began decrease reached present value magnitude continue decrease month day equal age earth rotating slowly braking action tide cause earth always keep face moon rotate axis time moon turn round earth nothing earth moon involved state affair would final also effect solar tide considered moon make day equal month sun tendency still slowing earth rotation axis make day equal year would course making earth take long turn axis go round sun succeed owing action moon
