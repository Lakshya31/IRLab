archive part library called zipgraph provides several level functionality lowlevel routine handle basic task determination installed adapter type plotting pixel future segment cover drawing primitive clipping region filling basic task highest level library present series c class built lowerlevel c code handle advanced routine handle ray tracing modelling animation obvious question might write graphic module dozen commercial graphic library c almost every compiler vendor includes graphic routine zipgraph offer others nt several goal mind building zipgraph begin wanted fast current version twice fast graphic library tried surprised find clanguage version lowlevel graphic routine nearly fast one built assembler language advantage easily maintainable c source far outweighed percentage point loss speed compared assembler language implementation second goal make zipgraph portable time pass article involve program graphic ala c compiler vendor interest making proprietary graphic library compatible write program using borland graphic interface bgi included turbo c program wont compile c compiler rather shut people decided build library compiled popular compiler version zipgraph presented compiles borland turbo c  lattice c  microsoft c  quickc  zortech cc  addition resulting object module linked microsoft fortran  stony brook modula  final reason writing zipgraph find commercial library limited example include printer routine support certain graphic adapter top lack fundamental capability function generate nonorthagonal ellipsis graphic library know completely support ray tracing animation object rotation plotting additionally commercial library written using c assembler language without utilizing object oriented feature c see future column c provides ability fantastic thing zglwlvl module presented basis module zipgraph system us powerful feature c provides basic function detecting type graphic adapter installed machine support plotting reading pixel common ibm adapter mentioned earlier module almost line long making longest piece code ever published column subsequently forego long detailed discussion zglwlvl instead focusing technique used

hercules card handled special manner zglwlvlc since hgc supported pc bios way graphic text mode must set via special function zipgraph function make exception normal setup calling special hercules function rather bios used graphic card ready plot pixel different video mode require different pixel plotting reading routine use pointer function task zgplotpixel zgreadpixel used exactly regular function however different thing based specific type graphic adapter installed value set based graphic mode requested via zgsetmode way look upon form polymorphism objectoriented programming concept c document already run far longer wo nt go specific individual pixel plotting reading function work dying know pick copy richard wilton programmer guide pc p video system isbn  far best reference ever published nut bolt pc graphic programming doubt zglwlvl remain static obvious enhancement include support  super vga mode x graphic additionally would nice add capability use nondocumented vga mode
