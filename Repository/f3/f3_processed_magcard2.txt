summary reply following request subject mag card swipe reader need help hello everybody picked one swipe reader mag stripe credit card etc surplus outfit american science surplus evanston il  interested complete unit keypad display etc rather gut subassembly actually read card hey expect  since surplus taken larger piece equipment doc sucker hope someone else picked one thing play doc figured enough get work tell contact get info beast figured would good place ask since seen people asking swipe card reader recently anyway description unit  long  wide maybe  high consists metal backing plate attached black plastic guide channel swipe card one side plastic channel read head mag stripe opposite side small printed circuit board removing plastic guide mounting plate reveals manufacturer sr corporation tokyo japan model number mcrr serial number also listed sr logolettering appears component side pc board foil side board sr repeated along code  fnc   upper right hand corner board one ic ca nt easily see number chip sure kind pin dip spot another chip pin dip screened label read  ic  chip resistor capacitor etc missing finally wire coming assembly terminating small connector similar power supply connector   floppy drive wire red yellow green blue black nt hacked thing yet since nt know power requirement even power lead data lead anyone information puppy might help love hear please email share whatever find anyone interested thanks  editor note following concatenation reply received netrequest reply included information posted net mag stripe card encoded case anyone missed finally included software threw together play card reader file contains information subject addition welcome notice nt get farther simply reading raw signal card two card reader ordered one completely doa faulty clock output least assume clock output never able read sort signal line someone fully functional reader easily extend wrote get decode actual data content card decide make modification andor extension appreciate copy whatever change make email tmkk uiucedu enjoy subject mag card swipe reader need help truly amazed someone else trying use device got mine year ago spent time trying find manufacturer found listing sr noth america technical directory public library found listing american sale office los angeles tried calling company gone business listing local phone directory either tried calling head office japan also gone business nt seen company listed recent electronics directory think really gone spent hour looking signal output device one signal line status line indicates card moved unit line pulse response magnetic card believe ic performs manchester decoding clock recovery read channel one output line data clock far got year ago forgot receive info please send copy  finally wire coming assembly terminating small connector similar power supply connector   floppy drive wire red yellow green blue black anything like unit worked think find five wire v gnd clock data card detected nt know active level wire  picked week ago magnetic credit card reader another surplus outfit cost sam e card reader made magtek diffrent reder many way reader ic standard ttl chip could easily quess power requiments v power connector card reader pin connector put power reader started examine signal multimeter little crystal earphine favourite electronics hacking tool found output signal something like data data clock data readable card ath end reader connected reader joystick port sx made little turbo pascal program reading card spare printer port
