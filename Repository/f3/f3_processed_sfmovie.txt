 moment sloppiness script nt bad lot action decent plot vehicle bring game character onscreen unlike movie day much commercialism beyond basic premise street fighter movie visit set way similar hope mortal kombat movie slated spring release nt seen script however would telling factor negative hit bullet point desouza background tv director hurt opinion shoot many scene use wayne campbell phrase  extreme closeup  fight scene imposing perspective also harder see going could used mask fighting skill actor minogue id suspect desouza eye shot happens nonaction scene would guess  street fighter movie  play well video result wait scene also dark musty easy viewing attributed sinister lair bison time appears poor cinematography similarly time audio nt sharp enough get character line make hard actor accent like van damme lesser extent minogue always come clearly rehash comment miscast van damme nt greatest choice character american military hero u flag tattoo jeff speakman capable fighter right hey even chuck norris could made guile haircut well maybe said nt bother much think better selection could made purist doubt think van damme laughable also casting role cammy could improved say kylie minogue bad cointerviewed desouza shooting began saying wanted lithe british actress martial art skill play cammy integrity minogue announced suspect marquee value overseas strong reason choice could played much part action capable choice made hey cynthia rothrock van damme play american soldier rothrock  veteran maledominated genre martialarts film  could probably played british import guess nt chosen casting director eh summary admit big fighting game fan result big street fighter fan mind probably best judge success movie extention game perhaps fanatic disappointed nutshell though wasnt disappointed  street fighter movie  actionfilm entertainment fact someone know really fighting game also said thought good take qualification de souza job bringing game big screen left seen
