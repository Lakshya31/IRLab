manufacture since lens quality something properly judged human eye one expect purchase quality optic bargain basement price simply put lens manufacturer must put production product greater must price optical lens highly polished fact optical science approximately five percent light enters leaf lens reflected back upon particular optical device contain different lens element like rifle scope total reflected light could conceivably much  percent prevent loss image lens manufacturer coat lens special antireflective coating especially formulated maximum light transmission percent coating specific type thickness process involves molecular bombardment coating material vacuum onto lens surface coating greatly reduces internal reflection increase image contrast enhances detail eye see impossible light entering front scope reach eye cheap scope darker image one great refractive coating job done lens also better scope enable brighter image continue see poorer lighting condition dawn dusk one trick help shopping scope look objective front end scope gather light poorer coating put lens lens act mirror reflect image better manufacturer use magnesium fluoride coating lens good scope poorer mirror image thus transmitting light sharper brighter image target eye coating material easily discerned color often seen purple straw faint green common type coating magnesium fluoride exotic multilayer coating provide enhanced image transmission time cost quality control involved coating process seriously affect final price unit since impossible determine coating thickness type coating
