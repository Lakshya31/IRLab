clean ibm pc keyboard david r bivens richmond va process owning operating ibm pc doubt find point time keyboard cause strange irritating thing happen fond finger stroke nine time ten caused dirt amazing much trash found keytops keyboard use week human hand carry great deal trash including dead skin cell addition leaning keyboard computer people prone cause much  head garbage  fall mechanism smoke find next impossible keep ash ashtray symptom keyboard dirt problem manifold common mistyped character missing letter miss key wrong character appear obnoxious time fix problem clean bugger must remove keytops blow mechanism air purpose message explain operation pc keyboard outline step necessary clean included note possible pitfall folk run pc keyboard capacitive device internal circuitry detects keystroke change capacitive potential wire matrix key mounted matrix contained form circuit board contains small  plate  connect device monitor capacitive level plate  toggle  made conductive plastic like ship ic toggle connected small spring held straight slightly compressed small cylinder thing hold spring compress small plunger attached bottom key toggle move holder change capacitive potential wire matrix cause keyboard logic circuit send scan code bus press key plunger move cylinder compressing spring spring already holding toggle away matrix pressure increase spring becomes  unstable  bend rapidly form loose  u  shape action felt heard  break  key key break direction pressure toggle reversed causing swing mm closer matrix detected keyboard logic circuitry change capacitive potential appropriate scan code sent bus processed lift finger key spring pop back straight position lift toggle away matrix see alot mechanical interaction going inside lowly keyboard amazes device reliable clean keyboard turn pc place keyboard lap remove key prying straight penknife small screwdriver pop check key gummy sticky matter placing dirty key pile cleaned soap water remove space bar youll find almost impossible replace properly removing key take low pressure air hose hair dryer blow stream air key tube air remove quite bit loose dirt inside keyboard dirt left place alter capacitive potential matrix thus  fooling  keyboard circuitry thinking key pressed word warning notnotnot blow key tube mouth blow moisture mechanism possibly ruin keyboard unit  spare part nine time ten necessary correct keyboard error clean key rest required heed warning mouth air remove matrix board key tube holder clean delicate operation notnotnot attempt unless need remove key matrix turn keyboard remove two screw bottom remove bottom panel keyboard disconnect berg connector hold keyboard cable circuit board inside unit place keyboard lap remove key carefully turn unit upsidedown taking care bend spring keyboard upsidedown pc printed circuit board right side see several metal  clip  holding silver matrix board black key tube holder one clip probably lower left bent silver matrix holder bend clip away silver metal hold two part together firmly slide silver matrix holder right mine least take alot pressure sure nt allow two part separate suddenly floor littered toggle carefully remove matrix holder tube holder place tube holder safe place use clean slightly damp rag clean surface matrix board allow water get board allow unit dry may perform interesting test reconnecting matrix board cable poweringup computer may  type  matrix board touching finger dark panel visible surface board cute huh need practice reassembling space bar spring try put unit back together remove spacebar tube tube holder remove toggle place safe place note wire running full length space bar tube assembly wire spring keep spacebar tilting one side use spacebar inserted tube assembly wire must fit slot  leg  end spacebar try time plan reassemble keyboard reassemble keyboard replace spacebar tube assembly tube holder install toggle slot insure toggle correctly positioned hold tube holder upside gently replace matrix board place complete reassembly need press matrix holder onto tube holder sliding  ear  correct notch take large amount force sure unit jump hand replacing matrix board bend holding  ear  place secure mechanism reinstall key unit keyboard case reconnect cable replace bottom cover check unit proper operation tricky without key done test unit place rear edge nearest number key table front edge nearest spacebar air allow spring fall backwards insure false input signal may shake keyboard bit get spring fall bring system test key  tweeking  spring finger ibm diagnostics good test well replace key holding keyboard position dont hold keyboard like spring  prebent  wo nt function properly replace spacebar first one likely give problem object spacebar replacement game get wire slot bar leg must done one side time without depressing bar much pressing bar cause wire spring retract make reinstallation impossible tell spacebar installed correctly fact end difficult lift bar move vertically unit replacing spacebar replace key holding keyboard vertical run diagnostics keyboard insure everything working properly check small spring correct leaned back position key installed still problem reassembled matrix board key tube holder incorrectly take apart start  common problem getting toggle jammed installing matrix board hope educational  sure pain type good luck david r bivens richmond va
