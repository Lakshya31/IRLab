additional point emphasis may countermeasure supported system require interaction access control accountability mechanism mechanism employed ordinary administrative user section provide example interaction ordinary administrative user decision illustrate positive negative consequence interaction  explicit physical security assumption tcsec include requirement physical security system installation however tfm include section subsection state physical security assumption made system designer assumption satisfied management organization responsible deploying system evaluation physical security responsibility system accreditors explicit inclusion physical security assumption made designer tfm provide accreditors necessary input deployment system different operational environment provide administrative user important input sound definition system security profile example system provide trusted path administrative user usually assume set terminal port reserved connection administrative console physically separated rest user terminal entire lifetime system also common assumption system definition security profile ensures level trust associated physical environment containing system peripheral always dominate maximum sensitivity associated peripheral similarly section emphasize system allowing legitimate user access component eg removable medium used environment administrative ordinary user trusted access data system trusted misuse physical access permission environment use untrusted application may still require use trusted system even though user trusted access data system allow user access system component level user trust guaranteed tfm suggest physical control necessary counter deter potential threat physical access system component presentation physical security assumption made system designer enable accreditors determine security risk exposure assumed system use well required countermeasure  protection mechanism available administrative user security system depends directly security administrative command interface database reason administrative command privilege database shall protected ordinary user tcsec security class shall separated role basis section identify protection mechanism available administrative user ensure user aware mean available control access command privilege database protection mechanism manipulated ordinary user also usually available administrative user example user identification authentication dac mechanism available administrative user addition mentioning mechanism sfug already defines tfm section include description mechanism available administrative user mode safe use example use special trustedpath mechanism based physically protected hardwired console may allow
