sigarch date june th introduction power glove serial adapter revision hereto referred pgsa ii  box  provides microcomputer user mean interface mattel manufactured nintendo powerglove tm personal system powerglove dimensional input device capable providing user x z coordinate help facilitate software requirement addition pgsa ii allows user similar access sega tm shutter glass capability onboard pgsa ii low cost virtual realism dimensional visualization system reality hardware requirement hardware requirement ability user system accept standard rsc eiad serial data bit rate bps stop bit parity data bit pgsa ii come  standard  female db connector commonly used r device although user change restriction using adapter pgsa ii allows user gather input powerglove without know specific input device hardware level interface box provides necessary buffering translation user receive uptodate information position powerglove control sega glass availability although pgsa ii currently development finished unit ship early august information provided potential customer eager learn use dimensional input output device well potential software author drawn idea using dimensional device future product release installed base software socalled  parallel interface  us processor host computer special line printer port host computer provide subset function available pgsa ii  parallel  interface refined considerably user newer ibm compatible system machine owner le fortunate pgsa ii hope solve problem available request information internet news group scivirtualworlds receives uptodate information progress area viewing input device many reader newsgroup name numerous mention provides answer common question related use development device pgsa ii appropriate software alternately author reached internet land address found closing document although initial stage lowcost virtual reality fast becoming real reality software requirement although installed base pgsa ii exists easily emulate menelli interface designed project ron menelli abrahms gentile entertainment inc age pgsa interface provides user mean utilize new inteface box waiting software written fully support new box area sega support pgsa ii work currently available software utilizing rts control newer rtsdtr control designed glen harris product content pgsa ii system come standard adapter interface nintendo powerglove one pair sega shutter glass system terminates connector accept standard r db male plug complete set documentation also included documentation explian use interface program interface common language troubleshoot interface anything go awry enhance unit documentation also detail theory involved demonstration disk containing sample program help file included provided user state current system type included user must supply mean power generation jack included allow hookup many lowcost  brick  power unit commonly referred  battery eliminator  sytem powered ac dc voltage volt volt user must also supply needed powerglove andor sega glass system function perfectly without sega glass installed unit operate sega glass mode operation glass installed alone potential customer discouraged buying unit solely operate sega glass user r interface incompatible db connector either buy unit purchase sigarch accessory user wish enhance operation pgsa ii may many way although current version controlling software support current hardware future version software include support powergloves also future version controlling software include support one nintendo uforce controller device similar operation powerglove software upgrade registered owner pgsa ii receive update controller code finished along documentation program load new code interface interface  fieldprogrammable  mean update controller code made end user using special program user also notified product produced sigarch miscellaneous pgsa ii made flexibility mind user select following option standard board control sega glass using rts direct control control sega glass using rtsdtr direct control control sega glass using interface control select powerglove active select powergloves active select onboard sega voltage generation  volt power supply select user supplied sega voltage gen optional  v supply select high low initial baud rate plus configuration option user nonstandard r requirement cost sigarch still evaluating retail price unit factor tentativly support price  sigarch guarantee price evaluation finished sigarch looking possibility offering kit pgsa ii reduced price decision discussed thoroughly note cost largely determined number people committing purchase box upon manufacture since sigarch take prepaid order unit base purchaser required final production start
