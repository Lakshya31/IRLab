electronic bulletin board system bb combination hardware software let single computer act electronic classroom provides four main service message bulletin file door message usually public readable

electronically conducted class whimsically called  electronic renaissance  cross discussion group directed reading message feature foundation centerpiece student would use computer call bb phone line ran hour day whole semester using simple command would receive new message hang freeing bb use another student student forgot hang bb would automatically disconnect phone minute student would use word processor read message would question student others might include contribution ongoing discussion private message professor student would read write reply ask question perhaps broach new subject would call bb back post new message thereby making part general dialog occasionally student might download file ie retrieve document file bb even rarely might upload file ie send document bb course comprised sending receiving message  dialog creation management computermediated dialog formed bulk duty instructor dictated design course discussion similar different live classroom similarity outweighing difference substantially classroom student hesitant voice viewpoint others spoke almost first still others tended ask question rather write opinion message clearly stated others murky illinformed difference quite obvious evident annoying delay response student making observation might read response several day time original  speaker  moved issue learn accomodate leisurely pace conversation fact bb could keep track several discussion topic compensated somewhat slower pace time constraint medium caused difference welcomed notable student discovery cite source quickly found could discus material without stating book page number formed basis question observation early course began see message quotation paraphrase followed author page number also tended keep discussion focused idea presented book saw little pure opinion giving sort often hear classroom discussion tone discussion  think  also  source draw opinion  major role moderator posted initial question made opening statement brought discussion back track wandered lost focus tried liven flagged short professor discussion class seminar writing student participation formed quarter final grade plus requirement student post minimum three message week ensured participation everyone message obviously meant meet minimum lecture student make way reading tended ask lot question began create syllabus found rethinking almost every aspect course really objective student learn italian renaissance vital expendable change medium provided catalyst reevaluate form content  worthwhile exercise decided ultimately try reproduce lecture lecture note computer could easily posted outline nothing student moreover purchased five book covered various aspect subject thoroughly deliberately chosen book differing viewpoint posting  lecture  would given away point view wanted student grapple material directly besides goal changing rapidly rather worrying covering certain amount information semester time believed important goal encourage student ask question form opinion since would produce discussion course began became evident certain kind background information needed supplied book found writing message line need became evident discussion example explanation medieval money brief excursion church hierarchy student told course much appreciated little essay teach course regularity envision building library pulled occasion demand one obvious question several faculty asked art one teach renaissance without teaching art toyed idea transmitting picture technically possible could know whether student machine would speed power needed display picture decided instead spend couple week art even concentrate patronage nonvisual aspect two special project course one worked well one predicated assumption medium wellsuited cooperative task common goal one worked well time line student built together everyone required post weekly minimum five contribution time line event related area currently discussion thus focusing religion related gathered various contribution eliminated duplicate merged common time line posted file student could download view print wanted student finish course conception renaissance event making secondary goal time line project force student make decision relative historical importance arbitrarily decided time line would fixed length would expanded ran room asked student event  worthy  included taken unfortunately due small size class reach point almost end semester time student preoccupied term paper would certainly use project although would simply force issue earlier student often told important  teacher book learning decide believe vital part education exercise made process explicit could see choice compare made others reach consensus debate project work effectively failed primarily prepare well enough student choose city duration course would responsibilty discussion developed hoped student would advocate city commenting larger event say venetian milanese perspective problem however twofold first provide enough structure seeded discussion material would inherently bring differing point view eg relation papacy france second student really needed material work selected source reading maybe even one book view supporting project student made effort developing local point view eventually lost interest stimulating debate failed emerge detailed two project attempt show strength weakness teaching medium traditional classroom one could draw common time line collect contribution would difficult keep track contributed administration project might turn nightmare bb approach hand automatically provides tracking needed grading purpose every student message date timestamped organization planning key failure second project attests teacher clearly mind rationale objective implementation well course structured support project project likely succeed student distance difficult make ad hoc change require additional reading material teacher merely put extra book reserve library decided early course would highly structured traditional course student would need know clearly expected syllabus contained detail usual basis class discussion especially important everyone read material time syllabus therefore laid reading assignment week week usual practice along general topic heading student kept work class generally ran smoothly serious hurdle faced accessibility library resource upperdivision history course term paper required student living rural community distance university library real concern

create moderate discussion post document student use communicate among even form study group key done outside class time obviously believe electronic classroom potential student think thought highly indeed liking format alternative traditional class none want away live lecture always seem preferred medium student however time premium found unable attend night class upperdivision course rarely available night although placed rubric  distance education  important element student much distance time either take class free time odd hour simply could take class unanimous favoring aspect class best bb running continually could send receive message time could professor one ever ignored one ever interrupted teacher knew exactly extent quality participation also told quite independently class worked harder course others wanted message look respectable foolish sloppy gave careful attention instead proceeding carelessly class rigorous term paper exam found  wanted  perform level throughout course moreover factual information book could rely classroom lecture student said read book carefully thoroughly course medium therefore seems real rather subjective educational strength reaction harmony student thought general quality student response quite good perhaps highlymotivated wellorganized student would risk class like heard number report teacher computer conference used approach say much student like format work hard level discussion much higher live classroom also noticed  shy  student speak freely online racial sex stereotype downplayed precisely social cue come play
