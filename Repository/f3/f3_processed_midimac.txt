recent visit super interesting fest idea unix tennesse went across discussion implementing midi interface next workstation occured solution applied mac maybe use wide use found article bring light matter addition wish share workshop experience also edited slightly attached drawing supplementing power supply hope shall find useful doug yuill june ottawa canada inquiry source code comment please get touch email following address dyuill ccscarletonca included article describes midi interface apple macintosh october used unix computer employing zilog scc serial communication controller including next sparc workstation circuit described article assumes interfacing k mac premac plus provided  volt dc pin pin connector used serial port mac plus dispensed pin connector favor pin mini circular din connector provide power connector used next workstation included additional circuit diagram regulate  volt dc  volt required midi interface may unused ac power adapter laying around use able deliver least volt suitable go shopping part sure take power adapter select suitable connector also check pinout spec serial port work station see provides dc voltage output may need power adapter regulator circuit siphon juice serial port use power regulator serial port provides v dc also need pinout spec mapping pin number used macintosh workstation probably undertake project unless read schematic soldered built mine perf board using point point wiring although would use vero board sure buy small enclosure put purchased everything needed active component division future electronics although sure radio shack would need nt forget pair pin chasis mount din connector midi inout real tight budget could dispense din connector cut midi cable half wire directly assembler source code midi driver mac may use anyone writing driver unix doug yuill june ottawa canada article describe one way interface macintosh midi standard communication music synthesizer related equipment making hardware software change existing macintosh serial port midi port created macintosh equipped midi port act powerful controller musical equipment sending receiving midi data mac thing like record synthesizer music edit play back automated mixdown stereo implication capability great many function modem recording studio brought macintosh owner home midi stand musical instrument digital interface standard agreed upon various major manufacturer electronic music synthesizer midi standard protocol transferring data music synthesizer computer allows equipment made different manufacturer communicate originally designed let one keyboard instrument control another one could play keyboard synthesizer sound would produced synthesizer b originator midi concept gave enough flexibility allow thing well possible buy midi gear control lighting equipment mixing board well keyboard synthesizer important point remember midi recorder nt actually record sound produced synthesizer control signal synthesizer need produce sound instance key depressed synthesizer keyboard least three byte information sent midi cable code describing note event midi channel number corresponding key middle c velocity key struck used dynamic note event recorded similar fashion altogether take six byte record note duration make compact data structure compared actually recording sound order use midi port mac write serial driver far know driver routine configuring serial port must written assembly language high level language compiler allow inline assembly code order take advantage information presented article compiler nt allow may want read understanding may also want consider getting another compiler month coverage hardware interface necessary convert mac serial port midi specification software driver routine covered future article important consideration converting midi way thing baud rate midi clocked k nonstandard rate macintosh us zilog chip handle serial port order get mac chip handle data midi clock rate provide exemal clock signal use timing reference used oscillator circuit divider order derive k clock signal divided produce necessary clock rate k note may optionally use pin divider chip get frequency meg meg either rate also trick select appropriate divisor write register forthcoming software description external clock interface consists level shifting isolation circuity order make mac signal conform midi specification circuit pretty straightforward first need generate clock signal done circuit built around crystal two inverter two resistor capacitor crystal form meg oscillator drive l binary divider chip one output divider depending frequency want use routed capacitor resistor ground used offset pullup resistor internal l receiver chip mac reason necessary negative input l referenced ground need swing least millivolt ground order l chip recognize legitimate clock signal particular idyosyncracy mac rather annoying unworkable transmitted data signal line next consideration txd signal pin mac fed couple inverter stage provide ttl output required midi resistor diode front inverter protects negative voltage produced mac easiest part interface midi input port us optoisolator avoid condition known ground loop happens audio system slight voltage potential ground line two different piece equipment result irritating cycle hum audio output optoisolator keep equipment reacting way eliminating common ground connection sharp pc midi specified part although optoisolators schmitt manager output used output opto routed couple inverter stage provide rxi rxd signal mac want see left provide power ground connection according hardware information got apple  volt pin serial connector provide much milliamps output current interface draw one tenth amount clock signal may wired three way switch order switch three different speed may hard wired going using one speed far three speed used one piece software another
