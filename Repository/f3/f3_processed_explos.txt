assorted explosive information  common rocket fuel          material potassium nitrate kno  saltpeter  obtained drugstore ordered chemical supply house sugar powdered best procedure mix two together  nitrate  sugar take old cooking pan melt two together way ignite turn fudgey looking compound pour compound rocket engine cardboard tube set fuse compound let compound harden chlorate mixture         note main ingredient experiment potassium sodium chlorate equally well however may prove difficult find probably way get would order chemical supply house material      potassium chlorate sodium chlorate powdered charcoal powdered aluminum sulfur procedure      note set procedure making chlorate mixture special thing chlorate mixture chlorate experiment diffiernt proportion ingredient chlorate mixture made set procedure experimented proportion ingredient mixture however potassium chlorate sodium chlorate make sure mix sulfur charcoal aluminum first may grind mortar pestal get good mix ingredient add potassium chlorate sodium chlorate mix carefully mortar pestal grind mixture chlorate added ignite burn shit may use mixture whatever want chlorate mixture best composition experience best except model rocket propellant procedure making given later green goddess       material     zinc zn  note zinc oxide sulfur procedure     mix two together   make sure mix well best way put mixture jar lid shake  second greyish color ignite use fuse throw match powder warning burn quickly produce smoke also burn fairly high temperature surprise throw match delay sudden flash capable burning hell  common us      rocket fuel bomb  note best way take compress cardboard tubing smoke bomb cardboard tube w big hole flare bomb rest imagination good luck nitrate compound         material     potassium nitrate kno aluminum powder dust al sulfur procedure     take tablespoon kno tablespoon al  tablespoon mix shake one solid color silvergrey light fuse throw match light may experiment ratio tip make smoke add sulfur mixture b make burn slower add potassium nitrate c make burn faster add aluminum dust fun experimenting             us   high power fuel bomb melting mailbox rocket fuel high grade         note best composition rocket fuel one best composition ever tried mercury fulminate better nt care describe material      model rocket engine engine bigger one like c engine recommeded hammer procedure      first using hammer knock ceramic nozzle engine color nozzle light gray start see black grain gray nozzle powder put rocket engine shoe box something else catch propellant hit engine hammer get propellant careful hard propellant removed shoe box grain size ranging dust piece  inch size may take propellant use whatever wish warning ever grind mixture might explode face use form got engine also since nt know model rocket propellant made dont know poisonous rule however let get always wash experiment good procedure experi ment dealing chemical chemist
