internet case dcarea company digital express group inc internet access provider supplied least three thing actually get dialup slip access phone number modem connect personal  slip userid  personal

software call slip phone number using mac  kbps modem call answered corresponding  kbps modem end like one used bbs modem connected slipcapable  terminal server  black box take data coming mac dialup line retransmits internet access provider local area network turn connected internet using  ip router  another black box nt worry terminal server similar one used many college campus many freenets community network like capaccess connect user dialup modem lan actual unix host system login main difference slipcapable terminal server internet access provider extra capability let pas  raw  tcpip data access using ppp similar fact first connect internet access provider modem terminal server look much like logging remote unix system looking conversation typically nt  login normally handled automated script first thing would see prompt userid point script enter special slipppp userid would see password prompt response script enter slipppp password slip ppp software would prompt password nt supplied rest configuration information bb unix system next see opening screen menu unix prompt however slip ppp connection software terminal server go special mode start exchanging tcpip data somewhat reminiscent happens communication program download upload mode looked actually going across dialup line would look pretty much like garbage recognizable bit mixed however nt actually see garbage slip ppp software doesnt bother showing say  connected  couple important point note first made slip ppp  connection  really nt logged host capability send data internet continue telephone analogy plugged  phone   internet dial tone  nt called anybody yet might ask need userid password actually logging anything internet access provider want able bill time spend connected internet terminal server need id sort know connecting turn would like password one else connect slipppp terminal server bill time id think  internet calling card number  associated personal identification number pin really bit byte interesting technical question slipppp terminal server check userid password account connect time answer either check userid password internal database held nonvolatile memory terminal server sends userid password real computer system checked useridpassword database disk many modern terminal server done using kerberos authentication protocol invented mit slipppp userid check terminal server capability sends  start call  record real computer system stored log many terminal server use unix  syslog  protocol similar  end call  record sent modem connection end ie user disconnect two record together enable internet access provider compute time length slip ppp session billing purpose quite similar way longdistance calling card work analogy extends even always made connection phone internet access provider could theoretically use caller id similar mechanism know calling nt enter calling card number dial long distance home phone however might make long distance call road might connect modem different phone fact mac actually powerbook laptop thus separate slipppp userid password necessary handle another crucial piece left far  internet phone number  ip address case internet access provider assigns ip address mine  case youre curious fourth piece initial information given signed along three already mentioned slipppp dialup access number slipppp userid slipppp password many terminal server also ability assign caller ip address  fly  address picked displayed login sequence tcpip software pc mac pick us dial next time might get different ip address confusing might think turn various reason touched later really nt matter ip address long valid connection theory behind dynamic assignment ip address let internet access provider use limitedsize pool address serve much larger number people people need address connected modem slipppp terminal server internet access provider really nt need supply ip address dialup slipppp port however prefer way internet access provider one thing much easier understand especially using phone number analogy another ip address often used remote system identify connecting internet people use caller id identify phoning using ip address authentication way totally secure foolproof neither caller id matter  fly  assignment might get given ip address one point disconnect service someone else could get address minute later summarize signing internet access provider connecting slipppp terminal server  internet   internet dial tone  fulfilled three condition discussed help modem lowcost tcpip software  internetcapable  pc macintosh established tcpip slip ppp connection internet access point got ip address  internet phone number  ready  make call  ie connect system make use internet service long section still nt gotten point anything really useful patience believe even telephone dialtone would seem complicated really looked  cover  fact year ago  equal access  getting longdistance phone service u nonat carrier mci also pretty complicated may remember always dial special access number enter personal access code could dial longdistance number using longdistance company using core internet service end last section gotten point computer  internet dial tone  established tcpip link slipppp terminal server internet access provider ready useful work  make call  continue telephone analogy first thing example check electronic mail started eudora mail program eudora available mac pc running window first incarnation release  freeware program got copy adam engst  internet starter kit  book eudora also available commercial version release  somewhat functionality like mail filter official technical support recently bought copy release  qualcomm vendor sell support however explain eudora work digress moment talk internet electronic mail traditionally internet user logged multiuser system connected internet hour day user send mail say  jdoe capgwuedu   rroe agencygov  message transmitted almost immediately internet originating host  capgwuedu  receiving host  agencygov  put mailbox recipient  rroe  incidentally lowlevel protocol used send message internet electronic mail host called smtp simple mail transfer protocol later time recipient  rroe  log receiving mail host read mail message mailbox using mail program pine elm also compose new message sent recipient mail host described note user stay logged mail host entire time reading message composing new one method way used read compose mail using original internet shell account would login internet access provider host system  accessdigexnet  use unixbased mail program pine read respond electronic mail however computer linked internet directly would much prefer read compose mail mac send receive mac internet connection example mac internet address    even internet hostname  iondigexnet  discus internet hostnames work detail talk ftp unfortunately though ca nt use traditional smtp mail protocol least receive mail mail sent using smtp sent directly recipient host case would macintosh  iondigexnet  mac would internet receive otherwise sending host would able make smtp connection using intermittent dialup slipppp connection guarantee computer would online exact time sending host wanted send message thus would end never receiving message sent going back telephone example sending internet electronic mail traditional manner ie using smtp endtoend somewhat like leaving message someone personal answering machine call phone number hour day answering machine always turned ready record message case  internet phone number  ip address active part time connected internet access provider via slip ppp  internet dial tone   personal answering machine  mac wo nt always turned ready receive message solution problem simple another internetconnected system  mail server  receive email message connected internet download mail message system mac continuing answering machine analogy arrangement similar phone company provide via service like bell atlantic answer call place answering machine phone company provides voice mailbox somewhere network caller number leave message voice mailbox periodically call special phone number associated voice mailbox service punch access code listen message case rather sending email  hecker iondigexnet  recall  iondigexnet  hostname macintosh people send email  hecker accessdigexnet   accessdigexnet  name mail server run internet access provider system run hour day permanent internet connection dial internet access provider slip connection active eudora connect host  accessdigexnet  internet download message received since last connected specific protocol used smtp another protocol called post office protocol pop particular eudora  access  system use pop third recent version protocol technical jargon system  accessdigexnet  thus pop mail server nt mention also supply eudora userid password pass mail server connecting using pop userid password anyone else internet could connect internet access provider mail server download mail happens  mail userid  associated password one used use logging  access  system user internet shell account namely  hecker  corresponding login password make smooth transition old way thing using shell account new way using slipppp electronic mail address still  hecker accessdigexnet  userid  hecker  host  accessdigexnet  nt choose new password nt want also ever want need still dial  accessdigexnet  system old way ie using vtcompatible communication program instead slip ppp login read mail using pine mailbox format used pop standard unix mailbox format used pine elm hostbased mail program however mail userid password slipppp userid password previously mentioned talking two fundamentally different service provided two fundamentally different way slipppp access lowlevel communication service accessed dialing slippppcapable terminal server pop email access higherlevel service accessed connecting internet popcapable host system mail server thus get new slip ppp account internet access provider youll receive email pop userid password addition slipppp userid password exception smaller internet access provider separate terminal server rather connect modem directly serial line unix host system support slip ppp access using software running system case user  correctly slip software executing automated login script  would login host system using single userid password would invoke special slip ppp function convert session slip ppp connection eudora pop mail program would use userid password download mail suppose fulltime hardwired internet connection home example like starting provided cable company could  internet dial tone  time would nt need something like slip ppp connect also wouldnt need equivalent slipppp userid password discussed previously main use authentication billing internet access cable company already perfectly good way bill cablebased service however might still want cable company store incoming electronic mail message example might want keep computer turned time case could use eudora pop connect remote mail server slip ppp would still mail userid password supplied cable company role internet access provider continuing answering machine analogy electronic mailbox accessed using pop thus viewed valueadded option basic internet connection voice mailbox bell atlantic answer call valueadded option basic phone line also implies email service could  unbundled  basic internet service example might basic internet connection electronic mail service likely might get basic internet service one service provider electronic mailbox service another happens nt know internet access provider currently unbundles popbased email way however competition heat internet access market company may choose break current service standard optional offering order offer lowest entrylevel price possible may also market niche company providing slipppp service customer expected arrange electronic mail service nonprofit internet cooperative business way today back eudora mentioned eudora downloaded incoming email message mac read leisure nt need maintain internet slip connection sending message nt need connected order compose message almost go without saying need connected order send turn historical reason fancy way saying  thats way  pop protocol used sending electronic mail message instead eudora us smtp protocol discussed earlier twist  smtp classic  sending host mac case connects directly receiving host say  whitehousegov  sending message bill clinton however receiving host might unreachable due internet problem eudora would postpone sending message later time say hour later go trouble remembering reconnect periodically internet access provider instead happens eudora us smtp protocol send message mail server server us smtp send message final destination mail server ca nt right away keep trying succeeds meanwhile disconnect mac worry may noticed nt say anything userids password sending mail mail server doesnt authenticate way sending mail via smtp tell eudora upload message email server accepts might ask  nt mean someone else send fake electronic mail name  reason answer yes certainly happens almost trivially easy send forged internet mail ever since internet mail began example skeptical ever get message purportedly internet access provider telling need know userids password reason wellknown way solve problem nt implemented depend encryption related technology implementation internet held hostage sort dispute seen infamous  clipper chip  controversy nt want rehash whole issue want point basic underlying problem  market  internet successful  product  based technology available worldwide public domain otherwise freely usable exporting encryption technology u legally restricted national security concern  public key  encryption useful type electronic mail covered software patent u thus least two major obstacle creating worldwide standard secure internet mail  yet another example obscure policy question eventually come affect u electronic mail case usenet news online conference somewhat similar worth covering point need digress moment talk usenet news work underneath usenet communication network per se rather looselyorganized collection host system exchange conference article sense usenet analogous fidonet pc bb world fact gateway usenet fidonet conference article submitted  posted  one system sent one system send others rather like chain letter usenet host receive article received host stored people read thousand usenet conference  newsgroups  several thousand usenet host around world thus might imagine lot traffic flow system every day much usenet host system typically store last day worth article want usenet access personal computer thus least three possible way get first could computer fullfledged usenet host receive conference pretty much question case given hard fit several gigabyte disk space laptop second could computer usenet host receive newsgroups much reasonable thing get software mac pc still receiving every article every newsgroup chose receive even article little interest third alternative use mac newswatcher connect remote internet host acting  news server  host  newsdigexnet  case receives usenet newsgroups store article long without running disk space assuming internet slipppp connection active newswatcher connect news server internet download list article ie subject line newsgroup pick article want read newswatcher download article rest left unread news server conceptually process quite similar using pop mail server described mail special protocol nntp network news transfer protocol newswatcher news server use talk however nt supply userid password reading posting news tell newswatcher email address  hecker accessdigexnet  used mark posted article coming also needed send mail someone lieu posting reply newsgroup however information used authenticate news server way might ask anyone internet use newswatcher nntp client program read post article internet access provider news server news server internet true using  public nntp site  anyone read case post usenet news article might add using server well mean possible send forged usenet posting another name similar done internet mail however internet access provider news server accept request anywhere internet accept request ip address hostnames know represent valid subscriber provider slip ppp service since mac ip address internet hostname assigned internet access provider signed provider news server recognize valid user thus ip address hostname used useful albeit totally secure mean authenticating user final point want make usenet news like access mail server access news server valueadded service basic slip ppp internet access could theory unbundled well might basic internet connection mail usenet news service internet connection mail service usenet news service internet service mail service news service one two even three provider presentday internet access provider fact unbundle service manner accessing internet service electronic mail usenet news enough slip ppp internet connection also need access special internet host host acting mail news server respectively access usually prearranged organization typically internet access provider however wealth service need basic internet connection first example using anonymous ftp download information file shareware mac fetch program implement ftp simply asks name host wish connect magic happens convert host name ip address analogous looking phone number connection made download file ftp site nt ask individual password nt really care well almost true first ftp site ask sort password even nt care anonymous ftp site fetch send email address eg  hecker accessdigexnet  password courtesy case ftp site logging access reason want record information second mild security measure many ftp site check make sure ip address connecting eg ip address macintosh match internet hostname associated ip address telephone term like getting phone number caller via caller id looking reverse  crisscross  directory find name probably good place brief digression internet hostnames implied earlier internet hostnames like  capgwuedu  ip address    people name phone number fact  directory assistance  service automatic lookup ip address given hostname vice versa automated service referred domain name service dns silently invoked macintosh every time give internet hostname connect lookup done querying special internet host called dns name server case server one maintained internet access provider ip address yet another piece configuration information get sign slip ppp service besides letting properly macintosh look ip address automatically internet access provider dns name server also maintains entry listing internet hostname ip address mac let remote system like anonymous ftp site sort check briefly mentioned mac hostname  iondigexnet  nt used much email sent mail server hostname  accessdigexnet  instead like directory assistance dns name service essential fundamentally uninteresting unless need use working usually provided internet access provider part basic internet service really good candidate unbundling however many internet access provider provide extra cost service whereby choose personal customized hostname like  hecker mycompanycom  continuing telnet mac work similar ftp tell ncsa telnet application
