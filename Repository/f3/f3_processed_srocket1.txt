use diet scale gun reloading scale measure ingredient chemical               put combined chemical plastic refrigerator container tight lid use soft margarine container sure lid tight shake container three minute made rocket propellant yellowish powder  making casing          item needed inch wide gummed brown paper packaging tape scotch tape foot length  inch diameter hardwood dowel single edged razor blade wet sponge cover hardwood dowel several strip scotch tape layed lengthwise onto dowel cut strip gummed paper packaging tape long lay gummed side flat surface dampen last inch back tape wet sponge turn tape start dampened end start rolling around scotchtapecovered dowel one layer tape around dowel moisten gummed side rest tape roll around dowel tightly possible problem many time paper tape start run one side correct like examplerun left use single edged razor blade unrolled portion tape right next roll start slit left edge tape cut across tape within  inch right edge tape partially cut pull right correct mistake viceversa last step making casing done rolling casing hold last edge tape flat surface moment slide casing dowel allow dry  also bake casing kitchen oven degree f minute  making nozzle          item needed durham rock hard water putty epoxy glue part part b six penny   ungalvanized finishing nail quantity amount casing made one length  inch diameter hardwood dowel  inch diameter drill bit  inch diameter drill bit six penny finishing nail  inch diameter make core rocket instead using finishing nail may use piano wire diameter must pack propellant around finishing nail piano wire removing finished problem finishing nail little row groove right near head cause problem pull finished rocket nail piano wire prefered nozzle made putty one first going form little  inch long plug putty one end casing must form  inch long plug putty otherwise  going tell make gauge case use much putty little required cut six inch length  inch hardwood dowel bought use casing wrap dozen layer masking tape around one edge masking tape exactly  inch one end dowel slide casing dowel run end edge tape look open end casing see cavity exactly  inch deep pack cavity full putty yet mix putty water small tuna appproximate consistency stiff bread dough pack cavity simply pressing wad putty end casing finger wiping excess thumb try avoid creating air pocket bubble done slowly remove dowel depth gauge let sit dry day lay cookie cheet oven heat  degree f depending many made hour hour min putty hard dry drill  inch diameter hole completely center putty plug would use power drill hand drill okay careful patient show make jig hold casing upright drilling hole putty plug wo nt tough job get thick block wood drill  inch diameter hole stand casing putty end hole block mount  inch drill bit drill press start drillin hole putty plug get hole well entered work carefully loading propellant            sugar rocket making coreburners make coreburner simply pack propellant around dowel mandrel mandrel removed leaf behind hollow core mandrel used short length  inch diameter piano wire well use finishing nail piano wire core  inch long core start inside edge nozzle plug extends inside edge forward bulkhead plug nozzle plug  inch thick mandrel  inch long make mandrel use small hammer pound six penny finishing nail block wood use pair wire cutter snip length exactly  inch using piano wire finishing nail drill  inch diameter hole block roughen one end wire sandpaper file glue roughen end wire hole block epoxy glue glue completely hard grind wire length grinding wheel x quanity made x rocket make x mandrel one block wood block made rocket use set rocket casing drilled end mandrel ready load loading rocket step one     load propellant must pack around mandrel tamp use must hole drilled right center deeper length madrel wire inside paper casing make tamp cut inch length  inch hardwood dowel sand end square stand upright drill press drill  inch diameter hole right center dowel depth  inch also use brass aluminum rod make nicer tamp instead using dowel use steel safety note access machine lathe job much easier  step two     next make paper funnel place open rocket casing fill  teaspoon sugarbased rocket propellant use small stick wire poke casing remove funnel insert tamp made drilled end end casing pack propellant around wire mandrel striking tamp small hammer repeat step tamped powder reach top mandrel wad tissue paper paper towel pound top powder plug keep epoxy glue used plug front rocket running sticking madrel tissue plug place fill rest casing epoxy glue hardened twist pull rocket casing mandrel priming firing          go gun shop buy ffff fine black powder priming rocket           prime fuse one rocket stand end nozzleup use small paper trough fill entire core hole top black powder bought must cap put teaspoon powder jar add water drop time stirring stick go mixture consistency toothpaste take small dab powder paste tip finger smear nozzle hole rocket fused primed make sure hole completely covered set rocket aside allow paste cap dry minute firing rocket           easiest way launch rocket glue onto guide stick use hibachi stick shish kabob skewer use drop instant cyanoacrylate model cement use white glue masking tape glue stick ignite rocket use electric igniter tape filament wire piece coarse steel wool priming cap attach end electrical lead alligater clip attach lead strong battery  volt car battery fire closing switch complete circuit current make steel wool wire glow red hot causing burn ignite priming cap  bout option slow lift prime fuse pyrodex nt fill core way top black powder put little  fun text file written typed cloaked warrior  august  pacific  watch improving socket coming soon ae near
