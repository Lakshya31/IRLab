story mel real programmer  posted usenet author ed nather utastro nather may recent article devoted macho side programming made bald unvarnished statement real programmer write fortran maybe decadent era lite beer hand calculator  userfriendly  software back good old day term  software  sounded funny real computer made drum vacuum tube real programmer wrote machine code fortran ratfor even assembly language machine code raw unadorned inscrutable hexadecimal number directly lest whole new generation programmer grow ignorance glorious past feel dutybound describe best generation gap real programmer wrote code call mel name first met mel went work royal mcbee computer corp nowdefunct subsidiary typewriter company firm manufactured lgp small cheap standard day drummemory computer started manufacture rpc muchimproved bigger better faster  drummemory computer core cost much nt stay anyway nt heard company computer hired write fortran compiler new marvel mel guide wonder mel nt approve compiler  program ca nt rewrite code  asked  good  mel written hexadecimal popular computer program company owned ran lgp played blackjack potential customer computer show effect always dramatic lgp booth packed every show ibm salesman stood around talking whether actually sold computer question never discussed mel job rewrite blackjack program rpc port mean new computer oneplusone addressing scheme machine instruction addition operation code address needed operand second address indicated revolving drum next instruction located modern parlance every single instruction followed go put pascal pipe smoke mel loved rpc could optimize code locate instruction drum one finished job next would arriving  read head  available immediate execution program job  optimizing assembler  mel refused use  never know going put thing  explained  use separate constant  long time understood remark since mel knew numerical value every operation code assigned drum address every instruction wrote could also considered numerical constant could pick earlier  add  instruction say multiply right numeric value code easy someone else modify compared mel handoptimized program code massaged optimizing assembler program mel always ran faster  topdown  method program design nt invented yet mel would nt used anyway wrote innermost part program loop first would get first choice optimum address location drum optimizing assembler nt smart enough way mel never wrote timedelay loop either even balky flexowriter required delay output character work right located instruction drum successive one past read head needed drum execute another complete revolution find next instruction coined unforgettable term procedure although  optimum  absolute term like  unique  became common verbal practice make relative  quite optimum   le optimum   optimum  mel called maximum timedelay location  pessimum  finished blackjack program got run  even initializer optimized  said proudly got change request sale department program used elegant optimized random number generator shuffle  card  deal  deck  salesman felt fair since sometimes customer lost wanted mel modify program setting sense switch console could change odds let customer win mel balked felt patently dishonest impinged personal integrity programmer refused head salesman talked mel big bos bos urging fellow programmer mel finally gave wrote code got test backwards sense switch turned program would cheat winning every time mel delighted claiming subconscious uncontrollably ethical adamantly refused fix mel left company greener pa ture big bos asked look code see could find test reverse somewhat reluctantly agreed look tracking mel code real adventure often felt programming art form whose real value appreciated another versed arcane art lovely gem brilliant coup hidden human view admiration sometimes forever nature process learn lot individual reading code even hexadecimal mel think unsung genius perhaps greatest shock came found innocent loop test test none common sense said closed loop program would circle forever endlessly program control passed right however safely side took two week figure rpc computer really modern facility called index register allowed programmer write program loop used indexed instruction inside time number index register added address instruction would refer next datum series increment index register time mel never used instead would pull instruction machine register add one address store back would execute modified instruction right register loop written additional execution time taken account  instruction finished next one right drum read head ready go loop test vital clue came noticed index register bit bit lay address operation code instruction word turned  yet mel never used index register leaving zero time light went nearly blinded located data working near top memory  largest location instruction could address  last datum handled incrementing instruction address would make overflow carry would add one operation code changing next one instruction set jump instruction sure enough next program instruction address location zero program went happily way nt kept touch mel nt know ever gave flood change washed programming technique since longgone day like think nt event impressed enough quit looking offending test telling big bos could nt find nt seem surprised left company blackjack program would still cheat turned right sense switch think nt feel comfortable hacking code real programmer one hackerdom great heroic epic free verse spare image
