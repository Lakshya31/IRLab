necessary ingite good firm hit something hard like geek window j jug bomb one short sweet get ahold glass jug put drop gasoline cap top turn jug around coat inside surface evaporate add drop potassium permanganate bomb detonated throwing forcibly rolling solid object sucker go half stick dynamite k kitchen explosive plastique explosive potassium chlorate exlosive explosive similar composition used wwi main ingredient grenade land mine mortar round used french german force involved conflict explosive relatively safe make relatively safe mean nt screw around shit either make nt hate hear phreak buying fucking chemical blew face take special care following step  one strive make sure explosive free sulfur sulfide pictric acid presence compound result mixture become highly sensitive possible decompose explosively storage one never store home made exlosives make enough need time never know stable blow one method obtaining sulfur sulfide free potassium chlorate get ordinary bleach manufacture potassium chlorate bleach  sodium hypochlorite solution obtain heat source hotplate stove etc battery hydrometer large pyrex enameled steel container weigh chemical potassium chloride salt substitute take one gallon bleach place container begin heating solution heat weigh gram potassium chloride add bleach bring solution boil boil hydrometer reading  battery hydrometer used read full charge reading  take solution let cool refrigerator room temperature degree celsius filter crystal formed save boil solution cool filter save crystal take crystal mix distilled water following proportion gram per milliliter water heat solution boil allow cool filter solution save crystal form upon cooling process purification called fractional crystalization crystal relatively pure potassium chlorate powder consistancy face powder heat gently remove moisture melt five part vaseline five part wax dissolve white gasoline camp stove gasoline pour liquid part potassium chlorate powdered crystal plastic bowl knead liquid potassium chlorate intimately mixed allow gasoline evaporate place explosive cool dry place explosive best molded desired shape density  gram cube dipped wax water proof use cap detonate block charge guarantee highest detonation velocity l letter bomb letter bomb simple make difficult part making sure detonate properly obvious bomb mixture aluminum iron powder best light version thermite since enclosed space envelope described mix well idea iron burn high temperature need little help aluminum aluminum burn relatively low temperature used catalyst sort magnesium used flashignite aluminum burn oron suitable temperature since going enclosed burn much hotter slower violence normal mix advise play learning mixture get insulated padded envelope type double layered separate layer inner layer go wonderful mixture one satisfied keep section separate might handy top magnesium outer layer either magnesium flash bomb possibly material choice fuse difficult part make fuse another set chemical iodine crystal ammonium hydroxide liquid form mix together equal amount use heavy amount iodine pressed time form new crystalline structure inch long highly volatile advise keeping protected impact power per teaspoon put protective cardboard lining put top envelope rig put pressure crystal package opened squeezing envelope tricky ca nt explain seal working letter bomb way since bulk letter bomb easily recognizable rarely make past post office frown upon use letter bomb mean getting even never know going detonate around even simpler way getting even take one also federal offence make send one proceed risk p pipe bomb yes part waiting  pipe bomb many form pipe bomb used today file cover  c canister  pipe  bomb pvc pipe bomb steel cased pipe bomb addition timer various igniting technique launching c canister      c  pipe  bomb      ok make standard pipe bomb go local junk yard anywhere matter get piece pipe size thread end outside cap one end drill hole middle pipe size fuse fill one ingredient listed earlier oil open end pipe cap carefully nt oil end could spark bomb fully operational ready implantation geek house car stick long fuse hole light guessed run pvc pipe bomb      pvc pipe one made plastic glued together follow procedure pipe bomb instead screwing end simply glue pvc type glue much safer using metal cuz nt spark plus glue strong end wo nt blow sometimes happens trying especially destructive put small piece metal gunpowder steel casing      ok far deadly pipe bomb take steel rod thickness probably least   bore center drilling one end nt drill way though drill hole side fuse follow method capping open end done regular pipe bomb nice thing steel strength thicker make wall bomb bigger bang size help also one problem though cap one end tends blow powerful cap hold fuel shoot fuse hole solution keep cap make clamp steel wrap around bomb end end hold place fuse hole drill tiny hole use ignitor preferably home made insulated wire take another thin steel casing fit bomb inside run lead one end use standard ignition switch ignitor set would probably safer use timer  timer best form timer found far simple egg timer wire connection around egg timer timer reach   two wire lead touching fairly simple igniting basically two way ignite bomb first fuse second electricity best way ignite bomb electricity use estes ignitor used commonly model rocket work quite well course method outlined steel bomb would use insulated wire would touching small hole launching well always fun able watch bomb blow without risking shrapnel especially night assuming bomb nt heavy launch estes rocket best one co scrape ejection charge rocket engine tape nozzle co back rocket engine wipe outside damp cloth failed last new year rocket blew pad slide whole contraption rocket probably front rocket co slightly larger rocket engine recommend glueing launch bomb though would use separate fuse one bomb electrical one rocket motor cut hole side rocket bomb fuse put long fuse someone light run flame fuse get close rocket ignite engine ignitor switch reason safe spot ignitor nt work r rocket bomb first must experience model rocketry go hobby shop buy    e  powered rocket probably cost good one plywood fin thought   largest available motor wrong go   shot anyway assemble rocket epoxy maximum durability flight fill nose cone flash powder run fuse seal opening nose cone model cement make sure fuse long enough touch motor ejection charge ignite launch baby  e  motor degree angle towards jerk house may take several try hit shotgun shell bomb material  shotgun shell  cork  roofing nail  glue  medium heavy paper construction paper paper bag etc take cork drill hole roofing nail fit smaller end larger end glue cork firing end hole primer cut paper make tube fit shell three time longer shell tape glue tube shell crimp rest tube flatten tape end might want stick piece clothes hanger wire rig bomb slingshot bomb need come straight sure detonate strapping tape used strap everything securely smoke bomb get potassium nitrate mix sugar put tin top sawed mix well throw lighted match still flaring get back get hot make lot smoke melt ground fill city block white dense smoke imagine enclosed area soda bomb material  granulated pool chlorine least calcium hypochlorite  sugar  water  liter soda bottle take quarter chlorine place empty dry liter bottle put equal quantity sugar add enough water make mixture soupy put cap throw splatter kind blinding noxious chemical go sugar chlorine dissolve water react bomb loud bomb take anywhere second minute go careful nt go first time leave next day keep trying get optimum sugarchlorine content maximum boom sulfur bomb easy one make go local walgreen buy box match box match go  next cut match head tightly pack liter coke bottle careful may take rest natural life care take type wick thermalite run bottle give second get away long wick place wherever light explode outright sure flame tennis bomb know tennis popular sport around world tennis use hollow round green ball known tennis ball people know th wonderful little ball used thing jack used handy explosive noisemaker need following tennis ball new possible knife box match kind strike anything tape strong first take knife cut small round hole tennis ball slowly fill ball match head full make sure nt drop ball fun stay hospital tape hole well air tight make one day geek walking get big bang attention fun bomb land make explosion powerful mix gunpowder u urine bomb urea nitrate used
