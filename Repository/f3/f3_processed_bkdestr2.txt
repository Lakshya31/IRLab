coil strong tension wire variation sodium glass jar steel pipe pvc pipe larger steel one optional steel lead shot optional sharp rock hard crystal formation pipe obtained good hardware store need also get cap end pipe steel pipe fit inside pvc pipe leaving room steel lead shot packed inbetween two pipe glass jar also fit inside steel pipe rather loosley leaving little space also note explosive device made without pvc pipe bb also added note steel lead shot bought gun store reloading shot gun shell considerably le expensive bb sodium chemical mention later obtained good school lab chemical

maybe mean must hide behind something big tough variation      increased explosion power may wrap steel pipe inside pvc pipe steel wire take wire wrap time around inside pipe cause pipe shatter rather break piece applied pipe bomb chemical option greater strength                    sodium water reaction strength violent potassium water reaction strength extremely violent rubidium water reaction strength insatiably violent curium water reaction strength hostile totally destructive note combination group chemical react water except hydrogen litium mild reaction though must warn curium water violent explosive ever seen especially used quarter half pound amount telling tnt nt even come close destructive power curium water even rubidium water matter explosive powerful treated toy used
