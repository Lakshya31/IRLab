subject matter regarding icenet past present future would like thank jim consenting interview response given jim spread two mailing first containing initial question second containing list  followup  question two edited together one article interview fez past issue icenews louie gave u fictional history icenet let get real story icenet formed jim icenet born february first network connection icenet completed decided start network satisfy curiosity network software worked network experience board nonnetworked since went two month initial suggestion put board came icefreezr remote sysop also persuaded northstar icenet starting board icefreezr instrumental getting u started first year motivational constant input idea nonstop energy create new thing board network way another one game loved install tgwn august first year attracted sysops participate local network fez wwiv software used opposed numerous bb software available jim icefreezr suggested willing see worked idea initially excellent choice made selecting wwiv basic bb also unique networking feature several month later curiosity set second board installed shareware version bb software could find great experience wondered software would work compare fez candidate experimented bb software jim searchlight wildcat major bb vbbs pcboard tbbs others dont remember nothing came close ease wwiv user sysop since area dominated wwiv many user already knew navigate belief easiest user best addition wwiv many powerful feature bb software nt particular networking capability fez comparison wwiv came top jim several month playing around found nothing even came close wwiv providing basic feature bb email message game file live chat wwiv provided easiest interface user accomplish participation area found many user comfortable wwiv already felt comfortable right away tgwn fez release number first version wwiv used icenet jim sure remember wwiv v followed closely upgrade  way since upgrading soon new version released fez icenet continued gain node goal set young network jim goal fun later realized potential growth started asking local sysops input network manual northstar provided initial draft published first icenet policy statement application still contains basic policy set time namely operate wholesome network modem friend also teach sysops network much fun always anxious new node join though slow beginning relatively never goal total number system still nt new system still mean ive got new friend sysop new user share early board set trained sysop lot board know crashed every board icenet least day trying rather exotic stuff remotely never actually destroyed anyone system though far know actually still sure sysops learn spite fez mean nt create icenet specific goal agenda mind jim goal ever really see manifested icenet today network growth solid operating policy good implementation wwiv networking capability making new friend way speak goal today beginning mostly thought continued gel fez first town node icenet grew jim icenet rochester ny mile away heady experience thought ld cost would kill nt shortly thereafter system louisiana joined doc sysop always first ld connect fez first international node icenet come jim alpha station currently icenet began exchanging email icenet stationed okinawa month pacific icenet system joined station manager currently gc international group first even though station manager come back state okinawa system icenet numbering node remain fine group board great sysops fez country see icenet expanding foreseeable future jim canada joined excellent system even though sorta international group suppose someone eventually help icenet get europe matter fact doc icenet recruiting fun gain contact rest world fez release wwiv va average growth rate icenet jim february august grew node lost along way think node icenet sysop lousiana contacted wanted merge small local network mine overnight grew node guess doubling network one day fastest growth term total number new system august icenet grown around node help jim wire switch mod multinetworking mod many talented sysops able join icenet without forced drop existing network think influx many really great board helped set good foundation icenet grew node first month release typically growth rate continued node per month geometric fez release wwiv va icenet grew staggering rate icenet  majordomo  feel jim ecstatic still nt call name fez sorry jim prefer use term grand poobah instead seriously though feel success icenet rapid growth due various multinetting software would nt possible without jim go  call anything late dinner technically recent growth since august  helped great deal wwiva icenet system many icenet many running jim wire switch mod including paragon growth part due software available u take hundred folk implement working together continue well believe thanks finest sysops wwiv world member icenet fez problem rapid growth cause icenet jim node new needed better way update network using message base method along program called icenetud icefreezr wrote get work realized update method relied upon sysop intervention going make lot system using current update time approached wayne help rest history netup used since though wayne provided two upgrade program fez icenet continued grow set new goal network jim nt think much term goal setting term keeping new idea coming along though one goal fully implement wwiv networking feature subslst icenews group update ping etc program developed along way usually seed planted another innocent sysop include isbipss icenet excellent space dynasty game project sponsored managed daryl formation group selection group coordinator icenet top ten list dr diversity continued development evolution icenet policy daily goal emptying mail box always challenge fez icenet matured forsee future network jim somehow matured nt seem like right word suppose still think icenet small growing network full energetic sysops want achieve excellence networking make friend modem know though perception different new sysops seeing wwiv first time discovering icenet exists major premium network fez well started user icenet back september  got still small remember general joy connecting louisiana system thought term matured seemed right like seen many network go way dodo icenet thrived icenet become premium network many others failed make lasting impact jim luck hard work sound network policy strong emphasis wwiv registration continuing dedication quality service user sysops make icenet great dedicated gc spend lot time working quietly without fanfare getting job done following sound practice invented network mainly wwivnet wwivlink learning others listening others avoiding trapping hard ball politics fun letting thing happen thought consideration nt think icenet last premium wwiv network several know depends dedication network coordinator heshe one must make happen starting meet new sub started subtype one one fez alright jim let get back future icenet jim see icenet future include continued growth staying current latest wwiv technology new innovative idea manifesting thing keep icenet sysops fun believe imagine node icenet hope encourage continuation new exciting thing always happening icenet foremost continued commitment fast accurate network update fez since birth multinetworking wwiv seems goal everyone ever bbsed start network advice would give anyone considering starting network ground jim frequently asked question start run network multinetworking capability wwiv many thought much fun would designation name let assure indeed fun however started icenet along friend really major network besides net link icenet found niche something new different personality start network today simple get one board join two system network serious think consider several thing purpose network going start network theme purpose network policy guideline operation policy way acting proceeding course send network update keep network running smoothly system must using node list network grows need distribute new file system timely efficient manner network theme  think like would think hosting message base case hosting entire network system everything go network nt necessarily involve theme theme purpose foundation theme provides special focus network new system interested theme attracted network policy  policy establish reference source dealing problem issue arise network something wrong able look policy get answer proceed resolve problem nt reinvent wheel write good policy look basic wwivnet guideline contain sound practice demonstrated work quite well believe short elegant well thought policy put network firm footing right beginning involve others preparation policy establish maintain enforce policy technical matter updating network  network grows need edit connectnet bbslistnet file new system system drop connection change numerous thing system within network want changed one big question get edited file distributed system network least three method email method message base method using wayne bell netup program email method  beginning system easily via email making file available download system method probably adequate system network grows beyond size begin find problem sysops nt get around installing file unknown system begin show email message base bbs sysop updated board new file message base method  one semiautomatic method updating network work well  system use special update message base message base would hosted would network validate message base subscribing system everyone network must subscribe message base would set one message storage type update network zip bbslistnet connectnet file one file called example nodelistzip uuencode file post uuencoded message message base subscribing system would batch file run maintenance something like copy c wwivmsgs updateuue uudecode c wwivmsgsupdateuue

message base one message file without extension msg normally case make sure delete file msg make sure initially setting method certain see way make method efficient give concept course capable could write special software accomplish update method something anyone easily relatively secure since host message base validate requires sysop intervention message base batch file installed using netup  icenet grew system realized something must done improve updating technique gone though stage using email message base even icenetud special program written icefreezr icenet alan carauna worked message
