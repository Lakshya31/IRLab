space skull bone covered membrane close usually month coronal structure still weaker rest skull directly beneath sensory portion brain optic cavity downward strike degree depending force could cause concussion temporary blindness unconsciousness brain hemorrhage even death powerful blow region located centermost point forehead nerve outside skull thus bone struck trap nerve could result jarring cerebral hemisphere concussion unconsciousness impaired vision paralysis maximum impact applied death could result brain hemorrhage sure know temple dont know located horizontal plane across top ear recessed part side head actually bone tip sphenoid trigeminal nerve run temple nerve control several facial function also passing middle meningeal artery largest branch suppling dura matter direct hit could break tip sphenoid causing enter brain meningeal could burst contact trigeminal could result loss control facial function compression brain hemorrhage concussion shock death likely result striking temple horizontal blow directed towards opposite temple eye located  uh think know eye sensitive even slightest touch held fascia bulbi soft membrane eye muscle make easy pop also soft blow reached vitreous body center eye eyeball would collapse causing temporary permanent loss sight deep thrust could puncture brain causing death located side head air easily trapped external acoustic meatus tunnel outer ear inner ear forced eardrum causing bust turn rupture hammer malleus within middle ear damage would cause severe pain loss hearing bleeding mouth ear bleeding throat via internal auditory tube also inner ear center equilibrium balance cerebellum forceful strike could leave victim sprawled ground balance blow delivered horizontally driving ear mastoid located directly behind earlobe recessed area skull meet neck filled air pocket used communicate middle ear thrust used rather apply pressure nuckle thumbnail upward direction prolonged pressure could cause damage auditory system known commonly nose septal cartilage substance make nose two strike used different measure iia horizontal strike causing breakage septal cartilage nasal bone rupture angular vein producing lot blood along great pain however enough stop attacker iid upward degree strike forcing septal cartilage internal nasal cavity crista galli small bone formation nasal cavity brain brain death would instantaneous compression brain located beneath nose lip area line running nose upper lip many facial nerve run area direct hit would cause sensory fiber relay shock pons causing dizziness hit would also cause damage maxilla bone hold gum teeth could cause extensive bleeding posibly scaring victim blood loss straight blow needed achieve aiming towards back head joint hold jaw bone place connects skull front ear joint really made separate joint thus dislocation unilateral bilateral degree downward strike preferably mouth open dislocate mandible jaw bone easier way break bone strike joint anywhere jaw bone really head turned one side reduces absorbtion blow neck method requires least amount force madible jaw bone course tip located end chin boxer use point quick ko hitting area sends

temporarily maximun blow unconsciousness paralysis could attained lie collarbone connects blow could dislodge collarbone sternum collapsing shoulder better target behind sternum aorta superior vena cava major blood line brain trachea pas directly behind sternum forceful blow would follow reaction dislodge clavicle sternum sternum would split clavicle sternum would forced puncture aorta vena cava cartilage bone would forced puncture trachea strike delivered downward degree angle suprasternal notch major death target bone side body run shoulder center chest support shoulder breaking clavicle collarbone would result collapse shoulder possible broken bone puncture lung possibly heart one thing mentioned simple break would immobilize victim due structural damage pain inward motion used
