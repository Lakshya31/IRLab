circumstantial evidence head shot grassy knoll c copyright w anthony marsh presented third decade conference june  much would like direct evidence head shot grassy knoll evidence may missing inconclusive suspect however may body circumstantial evidence would indicate fatal shot struck president kennedy head z came grassy knoll paper present conclusive proof head shot grassy knoll cite example circumstantial evidence strongly suggest head shot came grassy knoll example well known need reexamined zapruder film wellknown evidence head shot various study interpretation made study one done itek analyzed movement president kennedy head around time head shot note president kennedy head move forward significantly z z cite proof shot hitting head behind everyone else failed analyze

sure remember increasing measurement connallys represent forward motion increasing measurement kennedy represent rearward motion notice direction amount movement person listed figure z z occupant rear compartment limo moved forward amount unless four hit bullet practical impossibility forward movement must caused something else likely cause inertia due limousine suddenly slowed dr luis alvarez noted study average velocity limousine going elm street sharply decreased head shot researcher theorized secret service agent bill greer jammed brake took foot accelerator whatever limousine quickly changed average velocity mph mph head shot obeying law inertia passenger limo thrust forward relation previous position limousine evidence effect fact connallys continued move forward president

rather much earlier speculated page  six second dallas josiah thompson cite statement several witness thought shot came grassy knoll william newman felt family direct path gunfire given position seems likely head shot came behind fence grassy knoll tsbd emmett hudson standing step leading pergola said shot sounded came behind head left would place origin near fence zapruder felt head shot come behind whistled past right ear two witness behind corner fence w found probable shockwave m muzzle blast grassy knoll shot assuming weapon aimed limousine make rough calculation velocity bullet resultant angle shockwave although calculation decay shockwave difficult rough calculation yielded exit velocity bullet  fps would create shockwave least degree either side flightpath bullet three witness within cone shockwave would felt strongly know whether weapon aimed limousine aimed opposite direction open microphone would outside cone shockwave thus shockwave would recorded another indication weapon aimed found statement sam holland made josiah thompson shown clear copy moorman polaroid felt viewpoint looking right barrel gun given mary moorman position gun would aimed limousine moorman see head man peering fence foot corner interestingly spot w located origin grassy knoll shot unaware existence moorman moorman see side view weapon might expect aimed limo whoever man moved position quickly head shot one later zapruder frame stoughton photograph taken shortly head shot stoughton photograph never analyzed warren commission house committee unaware existence believe one ever studied found jfk library unfortunately resource properly analyze obviously government might reveal presence gunman grassy knoll one independent researcher dale meyers done computer analysis suggests person behind fence several foot right corner many witness seen reacting shot various film fell ground quickly others seem realize danger would expect witness closest gun grassy knoll react quickly dramatically shockwave whizzing past grassy knoll one best film observe reaction taken marie muchmore muchmore frame see hudson two companion step leading pergola seem reacting gunshot frame see two men reacting seems inconceivable men would reacted sound shockwave coming close behind grassy knoll shot miss head shot would expect see men react head shot fact react head shot would seem indicate head shot came grassy knoll based circumstantial evidence believe likely head shot came grassy knoll existing evidence examined information gleaned existing data novel analysis release withheld data could provide new clue allow u verify certain method acoustical study urge researcher look new evidence perform new analysis    w peter trower ed  discovering alvarez  chicago university
