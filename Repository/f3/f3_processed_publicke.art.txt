security authentication using pgp fidonet thought security authentication email system tom jennings  idea public key security system sum ahead time assert public broadcasting public key enough security authentication casual privacy need fidonet email network article assumes use pgp version  rsa doublekey encryption system implemented freeware new u securityprivacy thing technologically socially privacy take granted without much thought letter envelope   knock door etc try break thing underlying assumption well hard nt get upset others  nt get  right away find obvious thing nt vice versa assume really really need utter absolute security achieve pgp whatever sensitive sending electronic medium probably nt recommended article nt achieve bankvault security within fidonet common use seem talk privacy rather security speak netmail echomail traffic probably reasonable example read message week send dozen people talk regularly per week know  oh yeah said hows mother get file ok   even eavesdropper read stuff would barely care time though revealed message content could  personally compromising embarrassing real life example long time ago sysop net trouble net host message critical net host intercepted host passed got reply good want way ensure sometimes addressee read given message willing pay penalty wo nt live system restrains like stone castle moat need risk nt great background assumption let look two separate issue look first  security authentication security  given encrypted message likely someone ascertain inside assuming addressor addressee operating assumption take granted pgp produce file secure barring bug etc like doc say frontal cryptological assault hard casual privacy case probably got worry way figure going imagine youre net host trouble particular sysop notice sent flurry message local rc zc hmmm really need know message called traffic analysis prewwii germany nazi tracked  jew sympathizer  traffic analysis telephone billing information european nt get itemized phone bill longer  like u told information longer kept really believe  anyways security cryptographic strength turn way around anonymous remailers private internet mailing list eric hughes came trick anonymously remail message send mail destined system x remailer instead strip header info mail system x anonymity nt really needed though case simple remailing general fidonet need modest authentication sticky one u authentication determining person really person say think see nt fatal problem appears first let get obvious case way first need utter absolute security better damn well know person ahead time get key delivered hand think really want conduct business electronic link first place authentication case nt  nt  problem relativelycasual privacy use authentication almost moot people already exchanged key never met face face life may never spite feel know trust assume say environment need work plus fact got moment  potential key mean simply ca nt fullblast security thing much  security  expect need someone ive never met consider uttersecurity case bottom line fact already taken care pgp  know  real tom jennings  wrote article underlying social system frequently overlooked take care assume many people net verifiable number way determine really wrote article simply asking via fidonet uncover fake looking old nodelists see info name changed ask people might know public key scattered wind like plant scatter pollen certainly possible could fake   public key gain access method discussed detail literature however assuming real person fake person generating key using sign send message keyrings passed around chance detecting incompatible key becomes almost certain point even casual effort would able track least determine fake example mary using pgp month conversing friend acquaintance public key filerequestable probably appears hundred keyrings next month people get message  mary  making increasingly odd claim via encrypted mail impostor fake key order useful would also widely distributed curious someone sends mary message encrypted appears public key plaintext one telling cyphertext encrypted public key suggests ca nt decipher someone may faked key mary actually depends many thing indeed creating crazy message well problem elsewhere find ca nt read message recourse depends available public key repository would advised contact notify alleged faked key follow whatever process setup generate new key knowledge key collision would enough flag user potential problem practical issue limit need traditional security measure key even stored private key disk would take physical access machine get worried private fidonet mail fidonet member try break house system get key got trouble practically speaking might even good idea two key small bit one casual email privacy big one bit give people hand diskette small key mean better performance important bulk casual email certainly adequate eavesdropping highsecurity need people nt certainly nt performance penalty probably wo nt matter much worst part security system people rely absolute thing make faked encrypted message worse faked plaintext message important remember goal could ever possibly agree single goal   privacy ability stop eavesdropper broadcast public key system adequate public key repository even better want maximumsecurity vault take added precaution one system solve problem firm believer broadcast public key system email practical suggestion pgp use fidonet privacy use small bit key routine lowsecurity use netmail privacy people nt know personally nt get key physically public key encryption useful email ie fidonet netmail especially flow multiple host way destination current password scheme echomail link proven adequate safeguard basically public forum anyways security nt seem needed link adding key received via fidonet public keyring answer  want certify key  unless received key hand nt hurt usefulness key however someone later us public keyring wont lulled false security certification key done time passing keyrings around willynilly though counter  good security practice  traditional us actually good thing u  key repository  scattered throughout net exchanging keyrings well posting list  trouble key  better idea reserve large bit key people know ensure security traditional way pointed pgp documentation seems developing public key filerequestable magicname  pgpkey  public key keyring  keyring  public key asciiarmor file pgp kxa
