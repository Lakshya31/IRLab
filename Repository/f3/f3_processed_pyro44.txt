spiral wound tube frequently used wherever possible cheaper make machine handle thin strip paper nt make many wrinkled tube machine handle wide sheet since work hand need bother u glue good news material wo nt nearly hard come pyrotechnic mixture mentioned earlier installment different type glue formula variation flour paste select depending convenient dont feel like slimy work needed make muck mention success commercial white glue like elmer glue though tends make casing nt accept certain type end plug tightly would nt use rocket casing firecracker specially constructed also going cost lot flour paste experiment small batch like also possible get passable result batch white school paste thinned enough water make flow going make reasonable number casing need larger batch glue make fairly cheaply simply good homemade glue make strong casing made adding  cup flour cup boiling water adding  ounce alum aluminum potassium sulfate stir combination consistent blend cooled ready use flour actual glue alum help fireproof mess help act preservative important wet flour eventually spoil mess used fairly quickly nt count saving couple day especially nt try storing jar closed space flour spoil fermenting producing lot gas bursting jar spoilage real problem let flour spoil make glue silly question sound make slop kept month also kept reasonably cool dark place nt make full

good nt worry much little lump corrected later revolting part let stuff sit  day warm degree f place check nt begun fermenting drop pinch instant yeast fermentation finished bubble forming flour settled gooey layer bottom pool revolting brownish liquid get rid brown slop note much batter resting bottom container boil enough water volume twice size batter pour slowly stirring flour briskly start easy stir get thick hurry making cup time wo nt heavy enough hold still trying stir might want container clamped solid right batch clear smooth paste thats plenty sticky fine sticking casing together since already spoiled batch flour ca nt go bad second time need preservative plan use chlorate firework also add potassium carbonate dissolved water glue using make casing always put matter plan reason glue tends deteriorate slightly producing slightly acidic material old paper used casing also become acidic chlorate come contact acid produce tiny amount chloric acid ignite anything vigorous thinking potassium carbonate counteract effect acid making final masterpiece much safer would otherwise still common practice design firework chlorate bearing portion actually touch glue super hard pyrotechnic cement made mixing finely powdered calcium carbonate powdered chalk sodium silicate solution proportion vary depending amount water sodium silicate make small test batch check work best material sodium silicate thick enough remind maple syrup either thinned distilled water allowed thicken evaporation needed stir calcium carbonate got thick sticky mess stuff hardens wo nt

turn shower skin eye piercing shrapnel burst keep mind design little gem chlorate material like potassium chlorate barium chlorate among love fear use unlike perchlorate much safer chlorate form chloric acid presence moisture like humidity kind acid material cause mixture ignite igniting mixture inside salute piled box salute expect whole thing go impressive watch distance trunk car expect answer lot question authority pay higher insurance yes nothing like chlorate make firework thoroughly spectacular normally avoid problem passing formula use long realize getting place never used chlorate sometimes used star get fired roman candle aerial bomb speed get ejected actually blow chlorate based mixture dont blow want use use small amount nt try store creation long period time keep away firework neutralize acid adding base hydroxide base tend absorb atmospheric moisture screw burning mixture group compound act much like base carbonate also counteract small trace acid make sure glue contains carbonate counteract effect acid may form want eye finger last lifetime also good idea add sort carbonate firework mixture counteract acid add nothing performance powder furthermore change color powder burn covered element add color earlier file know example strontium salt give red color adding strontium carbonate mixture least give u coloring barium carbonate give green color sodium carbonate might give u yellow though also absorbs atmospheric moisture keep mixture burning properly use carbonate particularly important mixture contains chlorate sulfur sulfur form trace sulfur dioxide hydrogen sulfide become acidic water one earlier file series showed mixture potassium chlorate sulfur explode strike trace amount acid always present sulfur air form enough chloric acid explode hit let sit long time may decide ignite may potassium chloratesulfur bearing pyrotechnic mixture may behave properly first time try bite hundredth want experiment chloratesulfur formula use
