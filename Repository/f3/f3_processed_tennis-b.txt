nearly everybody familiar basic idea tennis ball cannon  type device ignited fire tennis ball one end sound simple enough making cannon shoot long distance eg  yard bit tricky purpose document guide reader production number different type cannon section    deal three type cannon ive built date want build cannon section cannon probably powerful made built tested easy build easy fire unlike vague netinfo seen floating around hopefully precise enough anyone little talent time successfully build cannon fire impressive distance interested theory experimentation unproven design author least check later section never serious accident cannon recognize harmless sport feel although simpler cannon fairly safe assuming standard precaution taken advanced model generate tremendous pressure barrel power simple device still amazes said keep point mind nt build use cannon willing take risk feel wary setting large fire cracker sport nt perfect person nt perfect guide nt mention something leave point nt mean nt important use common sense play safe wear eyeprotection eg impact resistant goggles earprotection thing blow make loud bang sturdy pair glove also must kidding  wear stuff thick piece

simple build design fire tennis ball foot also quiet   whoosh  sound cannon probably nt require hearing protection unless sensitive sound encourage anyone never built cannon build one first later modified  v  cannon design cannon extremely simple barrel made  pringles can found effect empty can cut metal bottom cut bottom cut cardboard side evenly possible ensure good fit tapeglue can together securely possible one metal bottom intact bottom everything else go top make sure joint bottom reinforced especially strong base bottom make small hole bigger  inch smaller  inch hole metal instead cardboard also work found hole side le awkward light need done make fitting tennis ball sit easiest fitting cut circle plastic pringles lid tennis ball snugly wedged may wish run wire string side near top tennis ball fall way cannon alternative lid use pop top curvedpart bottom removed pop fitting may shorten range cannon however would good time make sure safety gear cannon complete ready fired fuel put squirt two way side nt dump bottom wo nt work put drop bottom make sure plenty fuel ignition hole nt take much lighter fluid  teaspoon teaspoon plenty interested burning vapor lighter fluid soon put fuel stick tennis ball top wait second sure lighter fluid vaporized point direction wo nt injure anyone anything ignite cannon lighter match go well rewarded  whump  tennis ball shoot top degree angle cannon throw ball foot cannon would ignite hole may small try making little bit bigger make sure fuel squirted evenly side little extra near ignition hole fired make sure blow exhaust gas  lighter fluid must fresh air cannon burn cannon ignites weak hole may large use tape shrink size large hole allows pressure vent hole instead pushing tennis ball tennis ball may need wedged firmer allow pressure build launch use smaller circle pringles lid push side cola bit fired exhaust fume may blown hairdryer used quickly perform cannon fire nearly far larger cannon roughly expect foot can   tennis ball cannon v well first cannon good start nt impressive real noise could easily throw tennis ball farther hand enter exciting world  baffle  placing obstruction across half diameter cannon regular interval pressure produced cannon greatly increased suspect baffle slow combustion vapor allowing complete burn may correct case least triple range v cannon adding baffle warning cannon become much dangerous noise produced much much much louder  ear protection must cant stress enough personally lost hearing minute first shot  stupid much careful pressure involved also tremendous bottom end pringles always dented warped first firing always get seam blown baffle made metal potential produce shrapnel course tennis ball much energy heard cause welt close range strongly suggest first building cannon can fairly simple add one time  give feel much reinforcement use constructing cannon use pvc  blast shield  strongly encouraged range cannon impressive cannon fire foot cannon reach yard beware blowout first time baffled cannon fired probably find area around seam cannon split duct tape securely taping easily add foot range thus second shot always impressive first baffled cannon also harder fuel ignite first attempt may work well may weak nt fooled construction type cannon similar v except baffle best material baffle found side pop can use sort cutting instrument cut top bottom slice side create one sheet metal flatten sheet baffle middle simply make straight cut half insert metal sheet cut extends   side baffle seam can need cut shape sheet metal top view                      pringles using extra metal side use pair old scissors cut flap used secure baffle prevent blown ascii pic show crude flap onebyone bend flap tape securely may wish use wood glue help get tighter fit baffle alternate side cannon see baffle look cannon                               can baffled cannon side view something like cutaway view   make sure use lot tape reinforce cannon last cannon like made can used  roll first shot afterwards patch blowout ca nt use much pay special attention seam cut baffle make sure got plenty holding back blow firing hole bottom instead side consider putting hole side back blow wo nt hit hand would good time put safety gear fueling baffled cannon bit trickier nt clear route side get lighter fluid far squirting top flip cannon squirt ignition hole rotating tilting cannon help fluid get middle stick tennis ball let fuel evaporate second make sure wearing glove ignite burn finger near ignition hole wearing glove  hopefully hear loud boom muffled course ear protector tennis ball shoot foot yard take look cannon patch blowout plenty tape observe denting done bottom pringles damage done baffle cannon good shot baffle completely destroyed go find tennis ball cannon would ignite check fix listed cannon v baffled cannon take much longer vent exhaust fume previous firing always blow ignition hole push exhaust put fuel ignition hole ensure fume area cannon performed weakly allow lighter fluid evaporate see caution exhaust fume larger cannon vapor may reaching middle cannon try putting fluid bottom first blowing though ignition hole force vapor middle check baffle shot badly damaged destroyed refuel try sometimes seem fix   tennis ball cannon v section still  construction  writing completed tested cannon describe construction cannon basically v designed strength durability mind barrel cannon longer made pringles can  important benefit sick eating pringles point instead use thick cardboard tube diameter kind tube used mailing thing storing blueprintsdrafting plan etc good art store mailing store office supply store something like stock using shipping tube vintage   rocket cardboard tube work well ive seen cardboard tube wall   range hold much longer pringles tube using already metal end others nt think pvc endcap tincan appropriate diameter would work well sure use extra tape hold end help prevent shrapnel unfortunately cardboard tube lack smooth foilplastic coating pringles plan use polyurethane type spraypaint type coat inside prevent fuel soaking cardboard baffle made sheet metal type used air duct work ideal cut metal saw shape bent plier   design idea following subsection unless noted untested author designsideas submitted  cannonists  theory thought try note case experiment risk   alternative fuel fuel used cannon lighter fluid naphtha fuel available  reported much powerful fuel nt work experience gasoline thought would great wasnt able get cannon light may tricky use properly white gas aka coleman fuel thing would nt ignite propane experience worked quite well good slightly better naphtha propane certainly worthy study  alcohol submission also known denatured ethyl alcohol supposed powerful naphtha also supposed much harder reliably measureignite engine starting fluid submission also known ether one brand diethyl ether seems second popularity one drawback higher cost sure use sturdy cannon supposed quite powerful acetylene submission also known welding gas acetyleneair mixture extremely powerful potential ignited even tiny amount static electricity use caution calcium carbide submission mixed water produce gas closely related acetylene  follow similar precaution hair spray submission commonly available would imagine fuel would produce better result would also think would leave sticky residue cannon hydrogenoxygen untested produce impressive result potential dangerous hydrogenoxygen mix  produce best result hydrogenair mix also work air oxygen cannon filled pure hydrogen work fairly simple way produce hydrogenoxygen mix electrolysis water advantage producing gas exact ratio hydrogen alone collected byproduct dissolving metal acid aluminum foil muratic acid usually hcl work fine acetone untested acetone evaporates quickly sure explosive vapor propylene oxide untested military us fuelair explosive bet stuff would great use idea get probably highly toxic   alternative design cannon made pop can submission design basically cannon using combustion chamber  can barrel design may practical today due pop can pressedmolded rather rolled steel end put case top bottom  can removed can taped together suggest using plenty tape side prevent blowout especially shrapnel  chamber  hole punched top  lot hole  small hole bottom ignite cannon drop lighter fluid combustion chamber shake cannon help fuel vaporize cannon supposed fire yard another pop cannon submission similar v cannon cut top can  bottom can securely glue tape can together using top removed base cannon use plenty tape side use drop lighter fluid fuel range given claimed  significant  kick yet another pop cannon submission  another pop cannon  soup used base ether fuel cannon said fire yard juice cannon submission simple construction liter metal juice foot length natural gas pipe stuck top weighted mm film canister used projectile instead tennis ball propane cylinder cannon submission one certainly sound sturdy cut top two empty propane cylinder bottom one thinner kind used handheld torch squatfat one used camping weld two cylinder together weld nut ignition hole spark plug screw remote ignition cannon used acetylene gas aerosol cannon submission barrel take tall aerosol correct diameter paint can right large gunk engine cleaner can great make sure empty mean punch hole location discarded sure pressure remaining dremel tool grinder cut top completely includes removing crimp leave smooth end take opener remove bottom leave crimp ring bottom chamber smaller aerosol diameter large wd etc dremel tool similar cut top dome hole cut need   diameter form stop ball loaded punch small hole side near bottom want power use tall chamber quite pleased medium sized chamber ignition source handle get one trigger operated butane lighter piezo electric trigger zippo make one use lighter use red white long chromeplated steel extension lighting fireplace starter remove coil thingie behind trigger unfortunately coil thingie vary quite bit usable brass cap end unable solder wire brass cap solder wire post piezo thingie insert handle sort made pistolshaped handle attached flat board like crimp ring                           dome barrel  chamber                           flat board piezo thingie trigger  wire handle   construction using duct tape tape ringed end barrel dome end chamber sure fit tight drill hole handle want trigger arrange wire go first allow exit want attach handle flat board screw duct tape handle chamber run wire around hole punched twist end wire together inch stay close proximity strip end   make gap   test spark pulling trigger get long spark piezo make insert wire hole gap close center rear chamber test spark fuel make sure get good ignition weld can together tape slowly dissolved fuel use denatured alcohol difficult measure proper combustible mixture also much powerful naphtha caused handle ripped chamber test two layer duct tape solved excellent repeatability following fueling method naphtha recently fired sling gun around large arc get fresh charge holding barrel upright using standard lighter filler squirt second little le straight hole dome chamber make sure approximately second worth go hole dome fuel barrel useless immediately insert tennis ball barrel way dome wait second pull trigger nt get way ball hole ceiling garage shot use alcohol stick smaller chamber lot powerful naphtha   assorted idea try nighttime firing cannon especially starting fluid fuel supposed produce decent sized flameflash aluminum powder sprinkled end barrel supposed produce bright flash probably best viewed night try using one infamous dryice bomb bottom larger chamber instead fuel ignited really like make reliable system remote ignition idea success using modelrocket igniter steel wool steel wool sortof burn current passed spark plug may work well  get reliable remote ignition system sealing end cannon would probably produce rather loud bang probably shrapnel
