white dwarf neutron star black hole white dwarf star usually measured comparison sun mass star whose remaining mass sun condenses approximately size earth star contraction halted collective resistance electron pressed atomic nucleus matter collapsed star tightly packed piece size sugar cube would weigh thousand kilogram gravitational contraction would also made star white hot appropriately called white dwarf astronomer detected white dwarf space first discovery planetsized object seemed exert disproportionately high gravitational effect upon celestial companion call dog star sirius  time sun

discovery scientist accepted fact object thousand time denser anything possible earth could exist neutron star supernova giant star usually lose mass normal lifetime star still retains  solar mass exhaustion nuclear fuel would collapse even greater density smaller size white dwarf reason limit amount compression electron resist presence atomic nucleus instance limit breached electron literally driven atomic nucleus mating proton form neutron thus transmuting nucleus neutron resulting object aptly called neutron star may kilometer diameter sugarcube size piece star would weigh onehalf

fuel become black hole like white dwarf neutron star star density gravity increase contraction consequently star gravitational escape velocity speed needed escape star increase star shrunk schwarzschild radius named man first calculated gravitational escape velocity would nearly  kilometer per second equal speed light consequently light could never leave star reduction giant star schwarzschild radius represents incredible compression mass decrease size example mathematician calculate star solar mass ten time mass sun exhaustion nuclear fuel schwarzschild radius kilometer

anything falling black hole would disappear universe                                   schwarzschild radius becomes black hole  event horizon  hole boundary return anything crossing event horizon never leave black hole within event horizon star continues contract reach spacetime singularity modern science easily define may considered state infinite density matter loses familiar property
