indoor marijuana cultivation introduction growing marijuana indoors fast becoming american pastime reason varied increased interest experimentation house plant cultivation inevitable people would apply knowledge plant care growing marijuana many occasionally like light joint may find difficult locate source hesitant deal perhaps unsavory element society procuring grass course criminal aspect buying selling grass growing marijuana illegal buying selling smoking growing something privacy home without deal someone nt know trust best reason growing enjoyment get watching tiny little seed picked stash sprout become lovely lush house plant anyone even nt prior experience growing plant home successful crop marijuana following simple direction pamphlet problem past marijuana cultivation may find solution following chapter growing marijuana plant involves four basic step get seed nt already ask friend save seed good grass may come across find lot people already seed collection sort willing part prime seed exchange finished product germinate seed simply drop seed moist soil germinating seed first sure seed indeed produce plant germinate seed place group six moist paper towel pore moist sponge leave towel sponge moist soaking wet seed germinate hour others may take several day even week plant sprout soon seed crack open begin sprout place moist soil sprinkle little soil top supply plant light flourescent light best hang light two inch soil plant appear ground continue keep light two inch plant easy follow four step grow marijuana plant ensure prime quality highest yield shortest time period however detail necessary soil prime concern choosing high quality seed soil use best soil get scrimping soil nt pay long run use unsterilized soil almost certainly find parasite probably late transplant marijuana find excellent soil sale local plant shop nursery kmart wal mart even grocery store soil use property best possible result drain well sand also sponge rock pearlite ph   since marijuana well acidic soil high acidity soil encourages plant predominantly male undesirable trait soil also contain humus retaining moisture nutrient want make soil mixture use recipe mix two part moss one part sand one part pearlite sponge rock four gallon soil test soil ph litmus paper soil testing kit available plant store raise ph soil add  lb lime cubic foot soil raise ph one point absolutely insist using dirt dug driveway must sterilize baking oven hour degree sure moisten thoroughly first also prepare rapid evacuation kitchen hot soil going stink add mixture one tablespoon fertilizer like rapidgro per gallon gallon soil blend thoroughly better yet skip whole process spend couple buck soil container prepared soil come kind container plant container sterilized well especially used previously growing plant size container great deal rate growth overall size plant plan transplanting plant one time since process transplanting shock plant undergo recovery period growth slowed even stopped short first container use larger six inch diameter made clay plastic transplant simply prepare larger pot filling soil scooping little hole size smaller pot plant turn plant upside pot tap rim pot sharply counter edge sink soil root ball come pot cleanly soil retaining shape pot disturbance root ball another method bypass transplanting problem using jiffypot jiffy pot made compressed peat moss planted right moist soil decompose allow passage root system wall second container volume least three gallon marijuana nt like root bound cramped space always sure container use deep enough plant root system difficult transplant fivefoot marijuana tree plan ahead going get bigger small plant ready transplant permanent home two week keep close watch first week avoid root binding cost since plant never seem well stunted cramping root fertilizer marijuana like lot food damage plant zealous fertilizer burn plant damage root used high concentration commercial soil enough nutrient sustain plant three week growth nt need worry feeding plant end third week important thing remember introduce fertilizer concentration plant gradually start fairly diluted fertilizer solution gradually increase dosage several good marijuana fertilizer commercial market two rapidgro ecogrow rapidgro widespread use marijuana cultivation available part united state ecogrow also especially good marijuana since contains ingredient keep soil becoming acid fertilizer cause ph change soil adding fertilizer soil almost always result acidic ph time go amount salt produced breakdown fertilizer soil cause soil become increasingly acidic eventually concentration salt soil stunt plant cause browning foliage also plant get older root become le effective bringing food leaf avoid accumulation salt soil ensure plant getting food need begin leaf feeding plant age  month dissolve fertilizer worm water spray mixture directly onto foliage leaf absorb fertilizer vein want continue put fertilizer soil well leaf feeding sure overdose plant remember increase amount food plant receives gradually marijuana seems able take much fertilizer want give long introduced period time first three month fertilize plant every day rate foliage growth slows plant preparation blooming seed production fertilizer intake plant slowed well never fertilize plant going harvest since fertilizer encourage foliage production slow resin production word organic fertilizer worm casting may know worm raised commercially sale gardener breeder put worm organic compost mixture worm reproducing eat organic matter expel best marijuana food around worm eaten organic matter compost removed sold remains sold worm casting casting rich grow marijuana straight worm casting nt really necessary however somewhat impractical since casting expensive afford however blend soil make good organic fertilizer light without light plant grow country marijuana grows best sun source light amount light length growing season country result huge treelike plant part north america however sun generally intense enough long enough period time produce size quality plant grow ease latin america tropical country answer problem lack sun especially winter month shortness growing season problem grow indoor simulated condition rule thumb seems light better one experiment know eight eightfoot vho grolux fixture used eight plant plant grew astonishing rate light raised every day many type artificial light different thing plant common incandescent light bulb emits frequency light plant use also emits high percentage far red infrared light cause plant concentrate growth stem result plant stretching toward light bulb becomes tall spindly weakly topples several brand bulb type one incandescent plant spot light emits higher amount red blue light common light bulb improvement drawback hot example placed close plant consequently plant stretch upwards danger becoming elongated falling red band light seem encourage stem growth desirable growing marijuana idea encourage foliage growth obvious reason grolux light probably common flourescent plant light experience proven extremely effective range size one eight foot length set growing room closet warehouse two type grolux light standard wide spectrum used conjunction another wide spectrum light sufficient wide spectrum light designed supplementary light source cheaper standard light wide spectrum light emit band light standard standard emit higher concentration red blue band plant need grow wide spectrum light also emit infrared effect stem growth already discussed planning grow large scale might interested know regular flourescent lamp fixture type used commercial lighting work well used along standard gro lux light commercial light called cool white cheapest flourescent light mentioned emit much blue light grolux standard blue light plant use foliage growth come question intensity standard wide spectrum lamp come three intensity regular output high output high output grow nice crop plant regular output lamp probably quite satisfied result difference using ho vho lamp time take grow crop vho lamp plant grow rate three time rate grow standard lamp people known get plant four foot tall two month one light vho light one may raise light every day mean growth rate ate least two inch day drawback expense vho lamp fixture vho lamp fixture almost twice price standard interested opinion well worth light might curious amount light give plant per day maturation date plant dependent much light receive per day longer dark period per day sooner plant bloom generally speaking le dark per day better first six month plant life older plant bloom go seed better grass plant allowed bloom metabolic rate slowed plant quality increase age rate bloomed idea let plant get old possible allowing mature potency high possible time harvest one relatively sure way keep plant blooming ready leave light time occasionally plant go ahead bloom anyway exception rather rule plant receive hour light per day probably mature  month get hour light per day probably blooming  month hour light per day flower  month good idea put light timer ensure

resinous coating leaf get plant must convince need resinous coating leaf protect drying extremely humid room plant develop wide leaf produce much resin must take care let temperature dry room become hot however since plant assimilate water fast enough root foliage begin brown ventilation proper ventilation growing room fairly important plant one room important good ventilation becomes plant breathe leaf also rid poison leaf proper ventilation maintained pore leaf become clogged leaf die free movement air poison evaporate leaf plant breathe remain healthy small closet plant probably create enough air circulation opening door look although possible grow healthy looking plant poorly ventilated room would larger healthier fresh supply air coming spend lot time growing room plant grow better using carbon dioxide exhaling around sometimes quite difficult get fresh supply air growing room room usually hidden away secret corner house possibly attic basement case fan create movement air also stimulate plant growing healthier sturdier stalk often time indoor environment stem plant fail become rigid nt cope element wind rain degree though advantage plant put energy producing leaf resin instead stem dehumidifying growing room cannabis grows hot dry climate narrower leaf cannabis grown humid atmosphere reason dry atmosphere plant respirate easier moisture leaf evaporates faster humid atmosphere moisture evaporate fast consequently leaf broader surface area order expel waste plant put since broad leaf produce le resin per leaf narrow resin ounce narrow leaf one ounce broad leaf may leaf mass broader leafed plant people growing quality rather quantity since resin marijuana plant serf purpose keeping leaf drying apt lot resin produced dry room humid one sears catalog dehumidifiers cost around  therefore bit impractical  hobby grower  watering live near clear mountain stream skip bit quality water u supplied water city city add chemical water others add chlorine however varying quantity human year learned either get rid somehow live marijuana plant wo nt time acquire taste better see nt chlorine evaporate let water stand hour open container letting water stand day two serve dual purpose water come room temperature period time avoid nasty shock plant suffer drench cold water always water room temperature lukewarm water water excessive amount chlorine may want get anti chlorine drop local fish pet store important thing watering thoroughly water plant three gallon container much three quart water idea get soil evenly moist way bottom pot use little water even often seeps short way soil root moist soil start turn upwards toward water second important thing watering see pot good drainage hole bottom excess water run pot wo nt drain excess water accumulate pocket rot root plant simply make soil sour mildew soil said earlier must allow water drain evenly must become hard packed made sure soil contains sand pearlite nt drainage problem discover water feel soil finger feel moisture soil wait day two water soil near top pot always drier soil drown plant easily let get dry likely survive dry spell survive torrential flood water plant well water nt water nt need bug avoid getting bug first place much better plant become infested probably fighting bug rest plant life avoid bug sure use sterilized soil container nt bring plant outside growing room bet ensure stay growing room since bring pest fur examine plant regularly sign insect spot hole leaf browning tip leaf droopy branch find somehow spite precaution plant room full bug spray plant kind insecticide want use something kill bug spider mite probably bug damage marijuana plant one reason almost microscopic hard spot called spider mite leave weblike substance clinging leaf also cause tiny little spot appear leaf probably first thing notice however plant look sick depressed mite suck enzyme leaf result leaf lose green color glossiness sometimes leaf look like kid fungus egg tiny black dot might wise get magnifying glass really scrutinize plant closely sure examine underside leaf mite often found clinging underside well top leaf sooner start fighting bug easier get rid killing spider mite marijuana one best insecticide  fruit berry  spray made miller ortho also produce several insecticide kill mite ingredient look kelthane malatheon poison lethal human pet well bug detoxify ten day safely smoke grass ten day spraying fruit berry kill adult mite however spray every four day two week sure killed adult chance lay egg keep close watch plant take one egg laying adult infest plant chance one two escape barrage insecticide see little bug flying around plant probably white fly adult immune almost commercial insecticide except fruit berry kill egg larva larval stage insect damage suck enzyme kill plant go unchecked get spraying program explained spider mite section organic method bug control using soap suds put ivory flake lukewarm water work suds lather put suds plant obvious disadvantage nt rinse soap plant taste soap smoke leaf pruning found pruning always necessary reason one first place encourage secondary growth allow light reach immature leaf strand grass naturally grow thick bushy clipped sap move uninterrupted flow right top plant produce flower thick resin hand plant appear tall spindly age three week probably require little trimming ensure nice full leafy plant three week age plant least two set branch four leaf cluster top prune plant simply slice top place two branch oppose use razor blade straight cut want root top water root appear plant top moist soil grow another plant going root top cut end time diagonal cut expose surface water rooting solution advantage taking cutting plant produce top top resin name game every time cut top plant seed two top branch base existing branch pruning also encourages branch underneath grow faster normally would without top cut harvesting curing well grown marijuana want cur right smoke clean wo nt bite avoid  homegrown  taste chlorophyll sometimes make one filling taste like might dissolving know several method curing marijuana mild flavor mellow rather harsh smoke first pull plant root hang upside hour put plant paper grocery bag top open three four day leaf feel dry touch strip leaf stem put glass jar lid nt pack leaf tightly want air reach leaf main danger curing process mold leaf damp put jar mold since mold destroy resin mold ruin marijuana check jar every day smelling smell acrid aroma take weed jar spread newspaper dry quickly another method uproot plant hang upside get burlap bag damp slip plant keep bag damp leave sun least week put plant paper bag day weed dry enough smoke like many fine thing life marijuana mellows age aging process tends remove
