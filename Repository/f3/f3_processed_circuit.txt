circuit model consciousness lurker guide timothy leary came theory guess model map would better term human consciousness get impression started working early lsd involvement though nt yet able find first started talking idea suspect may reference high priest nt waded way yet book subject called exopsychology republished additional material recent year title infopsychology new falcon publishing good book especially valuable original source material whole idea really hard make sense unless already know talking however two excellent book introduce explain develop idea describing strong weak point let give thumbnail sketch big picture circuit model describes eight level function human consciousness different book call different name circuit like different circuit computer gear like shifting gear bicycle grade like elementary school could call burrito want like circuit anyhow eight circuit lower four deal normal psychology upper four deal psychic mystical enlightened perhaps even trippedout consciousness strong point system integrates two well theory deal one mundane psychology consideration transcendant experience mystical foofara octave ray spiritual grounding nittygritty downtoearth surviving human jungle first four normal circuit influenced much modern psychology especially adlerian developmental stuff part idea grow infancy various circuit activated begin function take imprint condition time obvious example sexualsocial circuit kick adolesence imprint taken first sexual experience sometimes happens back seat car panic wondering whether mom dad appear later life person discover nothing turn quite much back seat car especially feel bit panicked rundown first four circuit st circuit survivalsecurity thing okay somewhere connected first source thing nursing mom nipple people take imprint thing arent safe time may compensate eating especially sweet thing pudding nursery food make feel better imprint taken early nursing whats known developmental psychology oral putting thing mouth always fun nd circuit territorialemotional particular definition emotional feeling top world dump related basic primate pecking order stuff big tough dog little submissive dog later get turf little king defend others throwing shit form word lawsuit horn honking however prefer dump people one full stereotype example gave kinda male yet every female know much gameplaying woman woman traditionally made submissive men many case case case lot passiveagressive way table turned direction corresponds anal stage first imprint taken toilet training develops greatly kid start playing kid finding stand big kid always telling little kid rd circuit conceptual kick even school kid hungry learn circuit ability make mental model thing help figure thing clever imprint take whether feel smart stupid different smart stupid sometimes people bad time circuit compensate rd circuit actually happen note also different kind intelligence verbal mathematical visualspatial musical etc etc  robert anton wilson say   people verbal intelligence control language call intellectual  father clinical psychologist always mention particular basketball player forget claim genius spatialmotor intelligence regardless fact guy probably read th grade level th circuit socialsexual whereas nd circuit deal boss th deal cool come depending whether someone cool let get close running spectrum talking someone snub sex many subtle shade go way cool people nt cool enough talk  oh could never ask herhim   imprint take cool feel hard work feel way everyone circuit people get stuck one another usually got problem work area often one circuit get surrogate another especially underdeveloped classic example pathetic ie poor nd circuit imprint nerd try outtalk buddy show smart rd circuit order authority nd circuit dominance one idea came lsd research idea reach state flux new imprint taken much agreement idea set setting people taken lsd agree everything seems change experience slip back old pattern witness flower child unlike real dedication slipped back become businessmen whether slipback really inherent function lsd trip certain though may caused going back one regular environment shaped everything one pressure conformity old status quo one slip back thats theory way really find would try imprint process afterwards step entirely new life another place different people thing see whether slipback process happened nt tried radical experiment attached current situation change try theory  rationalize rationalize  think people changed better psychedelic experience nt get high time follow realization action improve environment accordingly leary felt goal work circuit one imprint led happy healthy life without always thing one way people always top never learn service always feel secure never learn take risk etc ultimately circuit would plug one navigated upper circuit upper circuit deal mystical psychic paranormal consciousness built foundation lower circuit almost overdriven version interestingly correspond well idea many spritual tradition reading description woman initiated native american sweat lodge described vision great spirit appeared told

became aware connection following series dream certain traumatic event youth replayed way made obvious real issue current thing nothing old stuff old stuff stuff worked uncover work pretty certain nt much undealt trauma left dreaming realized current situation provided flow anxious energy flow arose followed channel cut old trauma like flash flood follow old dry riverbed emotion seem run channel mind metaphorically speaking way psychic speak channeling material outside far put word master upper four offer case help someone else insight th circuit mythical intelligence realm shaman spirit animal god goddess dreamtime rd circuit draw model specific conscious world th circuit draw model pattern archetype make unconscious world telling story illustrate pattern arise archetype th circuit awareness working one realizes pattern played instead acting world one time coming direct contact archetypal th circuit outofbody experience factor x far reach much really understood since th circuit letting others get close even especially case sexuality merging make sense th might overcoming obtacle one physical boundary wilson suggests certain drug may activate various circuit something like following st circuit comfort food sugar dairy product sedative may deaden alarm sensation produce sense security alcohol example nd circuit stimulant general well alcohol large amount classic aggressive drunk rd circuit stimulant possibly doubt smart drug would fit th circuit ecstasy well many others generally drug defeat social inadequacy programming th circuit sex big one go mere satisfaction physical drive becomes oceanlike ecstasy otherwise marijuana hallucinogen moderate dos th circuit lsd th circuit psilocybin peyote possibly lsd many natural psychedelics th circuit ketamine excessive dos many drug may produce well produce neardeath experience note drug narrow affect one circuit probably much better technique activating developing various part self people however suggest became aware capacity use since upper circuit built foundation lower one shit together deal high stuff nt alli call short circuit energy higher circuit overamps burn lower circuit either temporary permanent condition apparently depending far overdo instance someone nd circuit aggressionsubmission problem may take large dose lsd may feel overwhelmed influx th circuit awareness hearing voice head feeling wide open flow information unable turn may result overamping second circuit feel greatly threatened even victimized universe much go far may continue feel even drug worn okay review order suggest reading prometheus rising robert anton wilson new falcon publishing great introduction lower four circuit wilson us cool literature joyce dickens illustrate section nd circuit human primate psychology witty insightful get upper circuit though kind peter although offer interesting idea raw us circuit model extensively novel especially illuminatus trilogy schroedinger cat liked try reading model figured angel tech modern shaman guide reality selection antero alli new falcon publishing far best handbook circuit model give lucid description lower circuit go wrong lost owner manual originally came human form aftermarket manual good maintainance guide upper circuit dealt tolerably well dont know anyone could really justice suggests exercise technique hey experimenting info psychology timothy leary new falcon publishing mentioned source material best introduction leary added astrological correspondances seem fairly offbase agrees otherwise much depth dug written really read linearly either connected whichever point relevant user time classic every bookcase circuit model another map map territory menu meal many falcon author fond quipping found particular theory one useful one trying figure head asked leary circuit model lecture picked obviously nt interested talking theory working crowd like sideshow huckster great job way enjoyed greatly bad gave research marketing though
