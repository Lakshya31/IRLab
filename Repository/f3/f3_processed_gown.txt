stress analysis strapless evening gown charles e siem since beginning recorded history human worn sort clothing either protection warmth however present trend among  fair sex  wear clothing protection warmth solely attract attention opposite sex specific use clothing female effectively catch eye appreciative totally unsuspecting male variety method employed bring libidoawakening infliction poor male one popular method employed female wear transparent seemingly transparent cloth good advantage certain area common example transparent nylon blouse another powerful attractant tightly fitted garment wellknown example type weapon sweater yet another provoking method actually reducing extent body surface covered cloth good example method modern bathing suit eg bikini delightful device sufficiently aroused masculine sex use durable fragileappearing cloth give impression moment garment slip better yet certain part may slip place best example method attracting attention weak susceptible male strapless evening gown effective strapless evening gown attracting attention present tremendous engineering problem structural engineer faced problem designing dress appears fall moment yet actually stay small factor safety problem faced engineer readily appear following structural analysis strapless evening gown small elemental strip cloth strapless evening gown isolated free body area plane figure seen tangential force f balanced equal opposite tangential force f downward vertical force w weight dress balanced force v acting vertically upward due stress cloth plane since algebraic summation vertical horizontal force zero moment acting elemental strip equilibrium consider elemental strip cloth isolated free body area plane b figure two tangible force f f equal opposite force w weight dress balanced upward force v cloth plane b supply force thus algebraic summation horizontal force zero sum vertical force zero therefore elemental strip equilibrium imperative social reason elemental strip equilibrium female naturally blessed sufficient pectoral development supply vital force maintain elemental strip equilibrium engineer supply force artificial method instance engineer made use friction supply force friction force expressed f fn f frictional force f coefficient friction n normal force acting perpendicular f since given female given dress f constant increase f normal force n increased one obvious method increasing normal force make diameter dress c figure smaller diameter female point however disadvantage causing fiber along line c collapse much force applied wearer experience discomfort problem complex enough female require back gown lowered increase exposure correspondingly attract attention case horizontal force f f figure longer acting horizontally acting downward angle shown one side therefore total downward force equal weight dress b vector summation vector sum increase magnitude back lowered f t angle increase back lowered therefore vertical uplifting force supplied equilibrium increased lowback gown since cloth around back wearer would supply force perpendicular vertical axis female would keep gown lady falling forward engineer resort bone wire framework supply sufficient perpendicular force falling dress forward away wearer considered unfair tactic among female actual force supplied divided minimum force required hold dress resulting quotient defines factor safety factor could made large desired engineer required keep framework light inconspicuous therefore compromise must made heavy framework low factor safety ingenious use framework back strapless gown may lowered cleavage impending assuming female naturally endowed supply vertical force v problem still left incomplete unless analysis made structure supplying force structure nature cantilever beam figure show one cantilever beam minus aesthetical detail removed free body indeed many beam reality removed free body eg certain artifact since usually two divided force acting one beam f distributed beam c exposure correspondingly attention moving dress line toward b unfortunately limit stress defined fa area stress act since f constant area decreased bearing stress must increase limit exposure reached area b c reduced value  danger point  second condition exists limit amount exposure vertical force f balanced sheer force acting area e internal moment moment cause tension fiber beam e compression fiber c dress line moved toward b moment increased increasing tension compression till  danger point  since evening gown worn dance occasional horizontal force shown figure accidentally delivered beam point c causing impact loading compress fiber beam compression tends cancel tension fiber e b increase compression c critical area point fiber subject compression due moment impact also shear due force combination low heavy dress impact loading may bring fiber point  danger point  several reason property discussed paper never determined one scarcity beam experimental investigation many female asked volunteer experiment along line interest science unfortunately cooperation encountered also difficulty investigator strength mind ascertain purely scientific fact meanwhile trial error shrewd guess used engineer design strapless evening gown thorough investigation made
