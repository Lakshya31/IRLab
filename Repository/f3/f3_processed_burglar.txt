rectangular box seen door business radioshack one business love use market home security line part deal second line defense area sensor sensor monitor specific area rather specific point entry often called motion detector sinnce anyone moving guarded room detected like shit way sensor achieve goal varies component part give general note observation alarm bypassing  magnetic contact switch magnetic switch common hardwired component found door window around world consits two individual piece switch companion magnet see fig  switching mechanism spring loaded lever make contact stationary metal arm companion magnet near magnetic switch normally closed circuit magnet pulled away see fig  lever released stationary arm circuit longer complete opening aprotected door window remove magnet switch since circuit longer complete alarm sound simple electronics since circuit magnetic contact switch normally closed wire cut defeat system cause effect removing companion magnet magnetic switch offer opertunity jumpering individual component since wire often visible one need remove insulation place small wire across circuit defeat bypass switching mechanism fig  main problem thief locate

inside get wire however ther trick burglar employ often hole drilled window jumpering done wire visible one way make wire visible unscrew switch give little pull wire probably stapled may difficult pull chance wire stuffed stud done carfully switch removed far magnet also possible magnet may unscrewed window taped switch done radio shack door window could freely opened  window foiling window foiling probly alarm everyone familiar grace window nearly every store america rightfully difficuly bypass successfully impossible window monitored foil foil stretched around perimeter window two terminal placed end foiling connected rest circuit foil part normalclosed circuit fine break occurs glass foil tear opening circuit causing alarm ring foiling often coupled magnetic switch lie big problem burglar break window heshe enter three primary method burglar employ defeating window foil amateur hand dont fully understand principle window foil cicuit try crude method usually unsuccessful sometimes smash window hope foil wont break well odds happening astronomical better try playing lotto amateur even try cutting entire window since allows get access jumper terminal slight movement wrong direction set alarm holding pound sheet glass one method work provided window large enough burglar small enough cutting crawl space window far enough foil undisturbed entire window covered strong duct tape leaving blank hole intended cut hole preferbaly square scribed high quality diamond tipped glass cutter cutter used trace retrace scribbed line glass get quite thin line determined deep enough thin layer modelling clay applied glass area removed thick wet newspaper shield noise laid potential hole tapped sharply around scribbed line practice glass break line cut duct tape serf shockabsorber also keep plass shattering falling floor mistake made layer clay serf deaden sound glass hit floor inside another method often often used jumpering two foil terminal visible small hole drilled glass near drillin glass always use carbide bit wire laid across terminal completely bypass whole foiling system wire fasten securly terminal avoid fall mission anyrate jumpering successfully accomplished entire pane glass shattered without setting alarm third method utilized one prior access premise one looking use razor blade slice line thruogh foil slice clean enough ca nt seen easily also deep enough circuit intact store owner decides arm alarm turnon discover zone zone covering window properly armed quick survey window foil figure system must malfunction decides call repairman first thing morning occurs window containing cut foil remain unguarded night possible owner could call repairman instant intelligent burglar keeping hisher eye owner find tear really nothing much without proper tool supply burglar vantage point heshe could able see repair owner making particular window act accordingly window foiling particulary easy bypass remember necessary burglar enter window either know window cut pleasant thing crawl terribly wise place seen crawling large hole cut windoew  burglary  written passerby well given basic encounter look part nt get caught right raven
