enough point writing software isnt going used case software upgrade free unless major upgrade like including c compiler nt believe selling something hundred dollar nickel diming upgrade eprom upgrade free send back original q need pay royalty game developed system bought system anything want itexcept copy sell  q future system work possibly memory eventually new version circuit board finished offer megabit ram standard price current board time likely special meg option meg version cost  q buy one board newer version hardware becomes available later upgrade yes upgrade future version hardware would send back old board along enough money pay manufacture new board determine cost manufacture figure base price cover printed circuit board socket connector plus inexpensive logic chip
