everything could possibly need put something together anyone addition might want suggest please mail post flame mail make sure anything say worth reading  warn safest method safe method make anything using potentially explosive stuff version hope safer others product three year experimentation homebuilt engine various method tried cause fewest explosion simplest make fly straightest remember one thing really start playing thing test test manymanymanymany time know work get best performance make one explodes ground see close nt want learn run quickly learn take cover quickly start using actually decide build something like consider rocket first built used military dangerous unreliable military call something dangerous agood idea take hint thanks greg deer large part information

            chop okay first little history experimentation rocket engine first method ever tried good old fashioned paper tube clay nozzle packed gunpowder found several reason simply work explosion common fly flew place created various form one form stick type hollow core used throughout various type lot research discovered number one problem gunpowder managed come formula nice rocket fuel cut misfire tremendously unfortunately tough time finding tube engine making much trouble experimenting pipe bomb using copper pipe end brazed closed decided try engine tube worked somewhat could put engine together rather quickly still exploded lot force typical pipe bomb little experimentation later discovered brazing pipe weakened considerably nonbrazed method used rather well discovered pvc pipe successful form born good stuff one important point making rocket powder used thing gunpowder burned pressure burn tremendous speed rocket fuel hand burn quickly le constant rate regardless much pressure formula gunpowder rocket fuel using either sodium potassium nitrate nitrate carbon sulphur kno gunpowder nanogunpowder kno rocket fuel nano rocket fuel percentage weight first thing note rocket fuel mixture use much carbon gunpowder counterpart second thing note use much le sulphur completely sure work lot experimentation analysis component estes rocket fuel number come try make powder refer kind manual done optimum performance powder milled nt mill mix best ability way mix stuff mass water much safer could also modify store bought powder adding carbon rocket fuel work sulphur use carbon softwood hardwood work burn much slower willow pine spruce work experience spruce easiest cheapest get burn couple twobyfours ill leave execise reader figure much add engine material needed powder rocket fuel recommended   pvc pipe   dowel tool needed drill   bit one match nail nail smaller better hammer saw bar fit pvc pipe plastic best get away metal wood sandpaper something else use shape wood hot plate stove metal plate sheet metal aluminum something like procedure put metal plate burner hot plate turn max done well ventilated area going melting plastic cut length pvc specific length depends long want engine burn  good start cut two   length dowel dowel able slide easily pvc larger inside diameter pvc take dowel sand one end end edge somewhat look sort like         take one piece dowel pound piece pvc sink   get                      dowel                   pvc hot plate warm enough take pipe place end dowel piece metal press slightly pvc bottom melt nt plate nt hot enough want melt end pipe dowel slide excess melted plastic ouside tube removed sanding cutting whatever make sure melt end nt press really hard one properies plastic melted circumstance slide metal plate really easily youre preesing really hard pipe slide away hand usually move downwards quickly sort diagram heppens       pvc     dowel         stand melted plastic warning platics general rule healthy pleasant breath take powder add mass water mix well take powder fill pvc take rod hammer pound powder hard trying turn powder single grain  rod        powder pvc     dowel   keep adding pressing powder   free space top pvc warning using friction sensitive rocket fuel nt try take remaining pience dowel pound top take drill small bit drill two hole pvc top dowel hole perpendicular meet wood top view look like       take one nail put one hole nail go hole extra left preferably nail ablso bit bigger hole use hammer bend end nail cut repeat hole take enngine clamp something take drill   bit drill melted end middle engine look like    top wood plug   pvc   powder  hole   bottom plug    hole close center possible drill  rocket build rocket experiment different depth variation powder  ia good start hole deep engine probably explode shallow well sit make nice shower spark nt try drill entire hole drill     romove drill clean powder powder tends build bit cut efficiency drilling also build heat powder wet nt worry make sure plenty room around though case powder set nt try use friction sensitive rocket fuel probability set okay engine powder wet safest way dry engine leave sun number hour applying constant gentle heat variety source also example might set hair dryer set low medium heat engine hour make sure heat source nt hot plastic melt possibly powder ignite alternative building method outline method used really nt though mean safe try basic engine attempt first rocket fuel moistened pounded drilled completely dry imagine considerably faster little bit insert sarcasm dangerous black powder considered friction shock sensitive impure chemical alter tremendously well friction nt normally problem heat generated drilling stuff going try make sure plenty room friend nearby  close take hospitalbury case accident engine set ignite something end easily accomplished drilling hole top plug make sure nt drill nail though keep thing together weakened top rocket nasty tendency leave without rest generally look like               whatever  engine  want blow              delay added sticking slow burning powder hole like lot sulphur little bp packed fairly tightly want go right away really necessary put anything like add little loose powder though case easy modify one thing explosion easiest method simply add little extra tube somewhat larger engine fill whatever want however much cleaner way make powerful explosion however make sure going go want go meaning ca nt get rocket fly straight nt try add two inch engine put top plug put  tube drill hole outlined fill resulting cavity whatever want use add second plug manner similar first result look like  regular portion explosive  extra plug  first plug second plug want shower shattering explosion leave nail top plug cause simply pop note powder top able blow top part method would also nifty parachute flare assuming parachute insulated using friction sensitive powder effect extra careful putting top plug preferably powder put kind paper cartridge none get wall plug inserted launch technique first thing making first engine test probably nt want go trouble putting together nice rocket complete fin nose cone one simple way getting quite possibly oldest method ever used take stick   diameter long tghe specific dimension nt matter much exact shape round square well must straight possible gardening store sell nice bamboo stick used holding plant work well anyway take rocket engine tape near top nozzle facing length stick tape securely good launch put stick ground make sure stay pointing make sure also slide ground easily fire rocket stick keep rocket le straight fly assuming decent engine arc somewhat though depending side stick engine one launch arc away side remember easy get habit  oh safe behind rocket go way  day forget put backwards thing move fast conventional method launching outlined various model rocketry book check local library one neat way launching rocket experimenting cylindrical stabilizer take light cylinder open end attach end engine way air pass method nice tube launched rocket look roughly like         cylinder engine  v        successfully used popsicle stick hot glue hold piece pop onto engine fired tube also managed fire simply sitting ground also used commercial parachute flare get flare one model examined used large aluminum cartridge engine flare guide  space left bottom end large hole punched ignition technique simplest way igniting rocket insert piece fuse hole light run minimum sec running time preferred acutally want turn around catch breath watch rocket launch see coming decide go way however second normally get far enough minimum distance get farther though another method use good old fashioned estes solar igniter battery variety lectrical fire method favorite first find unused unneeded camera flash open look capacitor big cylider somewhere probably capacitor want one rating v le used nt give oomph bigger one disconnect flash bulb wire somehow ingition wire also safety switch kind take fart plug camera rewire push button method allow put  volt ignition wire alternative type light flasher used siren strobe light etc make sure know though  volt really hurt actual fuse varies small wire attached two larger wire put end engine nice job even better however small resistor take  watt resistor think higher resistance better vdc really matter attach two wire solder probably asking   allows get multiple fire little resistor sure many tried one got nice big spark push button welded general safety stuff one thing exploding tends rather awesome effect also tad dangerous explode distinct advantage breaking fairly large piece unlike glass really nasty little piece two piece generally top half bottom half guess top half go le bottom however piece smaller fly outward le horizontally smaller faster normally fly max forty fifty foot rocket random flight path dangerous well sheer speed thing fly easily kill nt hurt course little flame end consider well little flame also capable setting fire many thing namely house tree fire desert lake help whatever make sure people nearby within mile supposed flight path good mumber go aside cover enjoy
