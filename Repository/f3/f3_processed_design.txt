designing every part every interaction within selfcontained computer world player able find overcome challenge design game without feeling unfairly constrained manipulated game player play active role simulated social environment emphasize hero quality character controlling character throughout game player establishes alter ego joystickcontrolled blip screen player intent purpose game environment becomes world player protagonist potential become hero hero always average ability enables go forth kickass definitive manner protagonist must undertake form hero journey take form developmental cycle

wooden story line drawing player simulated social environment game environment player establishes set goal context game game must respond kind providing kind feedback without feedback player feel lost impotent trapped inside artificial world instead participating interactive gaming experience must support action player thwart maintain illusion functioning living world game designer ensure minimum

explanation arbitrary change especially impact player character negative impact gaming experience premise player expectation player must know expect game world journey journey usually rudimentary explanation given explain game world ignoring purely abstract game like go checker game designer must establish premise story setting premise help establish initial motivation game way setting help establish tone take rather trivial form scope story match scope game argument  scope game  mean range possible association interaction complex political thriller story setting straight shootemup arcade game nt carry much credibility likewise game based popular movie asking trouble people carry memory movie expectation game setting disapointment designer expectation game important set challenge clearly know kind experience want deliver make clear right front establishing story setting premise premise game vary wildly game intended visually confusing surreal exploration inner mind let said front game intended accurate uncompromising world war ii simulation battle bulge different expectation set designer must set guideline explicitly adhere game experience fully support premise player expectation consider two space gaming genre sidescrolling  shootemup  shooter space combat simulator classic shooter like defender premise pretty simple destroy wave attacking alien protect people gameplay simple understand though game requires superb eyehand coordination level seldom seen today gamer premise secondary nerveracking adrenaline rush playing main reason playing recent example space combat simulator xwing based star war universe since based popular movie player expect lot game premise rookie joining rebel alliance although jump right mission start blasting tie fighter encouraged go training process animated sequence accurate portrayal star war universe build framework play game included novella set tone tour duty new recruit alliance ruthlessly hunted imperial fleet flying old spacecraft  flying xwing escorting crucial shipment grain dangerous imperial patrol sense expanded game universe exists outside confines game carefully reinforced information mission briefing screen story nt stated overtly luke skywalker know somewhere fighting cause balancing goal initial motivation player form informed several longterm goal default goal win game long term goal may  find golden sword   return peace land  player formulate number shortterm goal along way  find golden sword talk everyone   return peace land need collect peace crystal  shorter term goal might  get next level blow ship   find power booster want survive  shortterm goal standing goal goal always player mind continually contribute wellbeing character example  better get hit enemy blaster fire lose ship  game designer manages difficulty goal player juggle flexibility like allow flexible goal completion word like allow leeway order goal brought completion single order guarantee success putting together structure allows trivial depends kind game take old example consider classic apple ii game  castle wolfenstein  object long term goal game escape nazi castle wwii initially armed nothing pistol finding  war plan  secondary longterm objective since game begin player trapped guarded room clad bright purple prisoner dud short term goal get room without getting captured shot player move room room standing goal finding uniform keeping stocked ammunition keeping s getting tail balance short term long term goal want short term goal punctuated moment sheer terror part  hero building  process short term goal immediate compelling something simple  blow bad guy  long term goal drive short term goal giving purpose meaning game need purpose meaning doom good example gameplay compelling time think longterm goal  survive  absorbing game kind platform opinion another aspect goalsetting like idea open play case castle wolfenstein goal game escape war plan however player take long heshe want fact player choose use game open play environment effectively creating new game common game  nazi hunting  player would run around shooting everyone player would try get castle quickly possible ignoring aspect game castle wolfenstein punish player structure open enough contain kind alternate game gameplay part pleasure game come interacting enjoy controlling character screen making solve problem overcome challenge also derive satisfaction overcoming challenge skill dexterity set limited goal  solve puzzle  reach  puzzle solved  player able action seems reasonable given premise game goal formed based premise situation natural response would run like hell character able counter defense every move shot able move way attacked able counterattack least allowed escape event player made horrible tactical mistake made clear player know  fault  also knowledge  another way  player also want way gain advantage however temporary changing rule slightly example arcade game assault highly manueverable tank enter  jump zone  propel enemy vehicle ground giving player unique advantage player want biggest gun best armor give way earning advantage give reason really needing placing constraint player action must rationale premise may help establish constraint exist player magic hammer able smash wall work time unless  special wall  encountered hammer must react wall way perhaps signaled different noise animation sequence something worked past work way future unless kind new variable entered picture make variable clear nt give away secret nt forget emphasize heroic epic quality player struggle explosion must large gratifying climactic duel villian must satisfy player want look good provide opportunity reward dexterity cleverness experience japanese arcade game often reward pattern memorization instead providing way many japanese arcade game rely heavily memorization advance reward experience necessarily cleverness varying set pattern make game dynamic still reward memorization example prince persia fighting first swordsman fairly easy recognize pattern fighting style later swordsman slightly different appearance different pattern remember encountering fat swordsman first time getting slaughtered fell old pattern best pattern opinion one nt rely fixed sequence action move player instead recognizes particular tactic set circumstance allows himher act prudently retaining flexibility goalsetting process excellent example xwing particular imperial tactic used launching tie bomber wave tie fighter tie fighter mere annoyance compared bomber fighter
