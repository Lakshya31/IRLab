actual sample crust initial excitement new success discovery passed tv set longer show astronaut moving across sunlit lunar landscape earth scientist beginning understand immense treasure new knowledge returned apollo astronaut apollo program left u large priceless legacy lunar material data moon rock collected eight different place moon six apollo landing returned collection weighing kilogram pound consisting  separate sample two automated soviet spacecraft named luna luna returned small important sample totalling gram five ounce instrument placed moon apollo astronaut long ago still detecting moonquakes meteorite impact measuring moon motion recording heat flowing inside moon apollo program also carried major effort photographing analyzing surface moon camera apollo spacecraft obtained many accurate photograph better map part moon area earth special detector near camera measured weak xrays radioactivity given lunar surface measurement able determine chemical composition onequarter moon surface area size united state mexico combined comparing flight data analysis returned moon rock draw conclusion chemical composition nature entire moon thus le decade science apollo program changed moon unknown unreachable object familiar world apollo program told u moon gained exploration landing apollo july nature origin moon still mystery result apollo program answer question remained unsolved century speculation scientific study life moon despite careful searching neither living organism fossil life found lunar sample lunar rock barren life quarantine period returned astronaut dropped third apollo landing moon water kind either free chemically combined rock water substance necessary life therefore unlikely life could ever originated moon furthermore lunar rock contain tiny amount carbon carbon compound life built carbon native moon brought lunar surface meteorite atom sun moon made first moon rock collected could analyze two type body solar system planet earth meteorite occasionally fall earth outer space learned moon chemically different like earth moon made rock moon rock much like earth rock appearance use term describe rock igneous mean formed cooling molten lava sedimentary rock like limestone shale deposited water ever found moon dark region called  maria  form feature  man moon  low level area covered layer basalt lava rock similar lava erupt terrestrial volcano hawaii iceland elsewhere lightcolored part moon called  highland  higher rugged region older maria area made several different kind rock cooled slowly deep within moon using terrestrial term call rock gabbro norite anorthosite despite similarity moon rock basically different easy tell apart analyzing chemistry examining microscope obvious difference moon rock water almost terrestrial rock contain least percent two water moon rock therefore wellpreserved never able react water form clay mineral rust billionyearold moon rock look fresher waterbearing lava erupted terrestrial volcano another important difference moon rock formed almost free oxygen result iron lunar rock oxidized lunar lava formed still occurs small crystal metallic iron moon rock never exposed water oxygen contact earth atmosphere could  rust  badly reason returned apollo sample carefully stored atmosphere dry nitrogen lunar material necessary exposed laboratory atmosphere sample analyzed moon rock made chemical element make earth rock although proportion different moon rock contain common element calcium aluminum titanium earth rock rarer element like hafnium zirconium high melting point also plentiful lunar rock however element like sodium potassium low melting point scarce lunar material moon rock richer hightemperature element scientist believe material formed moon heated much higher temperature material formed earth chemical composition moon also different different place soon moon formed various element sorted form different kind rock lightcolored highland rich calcium aluminum darkcolored maria contain le element titanium iron magnesium inside moon like sensitive instrument placed lunar surface apollo astronaut still recording tiny vibration caused meteorite impact surface moon small moonquakes deep within vibration provide data scientist determine inside moon like  moonquakes detected year week terrestrial standard average moonquake release much energy firecracker whole moon release le onetenbillionth earthquake energy earth moonquakes occur kilometer  mile deep inside moon much deeper almost quake planet certain kind moonquakes occur time every month suggesting triggered repeated tidal strain moon move orbit around earth picture inside moon slowly put together record thousand moonquakes meteorite impact deliberate impact discarded apollo rocket stage onto moon moon uniform inside divided series layer earth although layer earth moon different outermost part moon crust kilometer mile thick probably composed calciumand aluminiumrich rock like found highland beneath crust thick layer denser rock mantle extends kilometer mile deep interior moon still unknown moon may contain small iron core center evidence moon may hot even partly molten inside moon magnetic field like earth baffling unexpected result apollo program discovery preserved magnetism many old lunar rock one explanation moon ancient magnetic field somehow disappeared old lunar rock formed one reason able learn much moon interior instrument placed moon apollo astronaut operated much longer expected instrument originally designed oneyear lifetime operating since long operation provided information could obtained shorter record long lifetime heat flow experiment set apollo mission made possible determine accurately amount heat coming moon heat flow basic indicator temperature composition inside moon new value twothirds value calculated earlier data equal onethird amount heat coming inside earth result produce better model inside moon like probed lunar interior apollo instrument provided information space environment near moon example sensitive device used detect moonquakes also recorded vibration caused impact small meteorite onto lunar surface longterm record often meteorite strike moon learned impact always occur random small meteorite seem travel group several swarm composed meteorite weighing pound struck moon detection event giving scientist new idea distribution meteorite cosmic dust solar system long lifetime apollo instrument also made several cooperative project possible example instrument still making magnetic measurement several apollo landing site elsewhere moon russian landed similar instrument attached two automated lunar roving vehicle lunokhods making simultaneous measurement exchanging data american russian scientist provided small example international cooperation space jointly obtained better picture magnetic property moon space around moon surface like long apollo program scientist could see moon surface complex earthbased telescope could distinguish level maria rugged highland could recognize countless circular crater rugged mountain range deep winding canyon rilles apollo exploration learned lunar landscape covered layer fine brokenup powder rubble meter foot deep layer usually called  lunar soil  although contains water organic material totally different soil formed earth action wind water life lunar soil something entirely new scientist could formed surface airless body like moon soil built billion year continuous bombardment unprotected moon large small meteorite would burned entered earth atmosphere meteorite form crater hit moon tiny particle cosmic dust produce microscopic crater perhaps  millimeter  inch across rare impact large body may blast crater many kilometer mile diameter impact shatters solid rock scatter material around crater stir mix soil result lunar soil wellmixed sample large area moon single sample lunar soil yielded rock fragment whose source hundred kilometer collection site however lunar soil groundup reworked lunar rock boundary layer moon outer space absorbs matter energy strike moon fro sun rest universe tiny bit cosmic dust highenergy atomic particle would stopped high earth protective atmosphere rain continually onto surface moon old moon scientist think solar system first came huge whirling diskshaped cloud gas dust gradually cloud collapsed inward central part became masssive hot forming sun around sun dust formed small object rapidly collected together form large planet satellite see today carefully measuring radioactive element found rock scientist determine old rock measurement meteorite indicate formation solar system occurred  billion year ago chemical evidence lunar terrestrial rock earth moon also formed time however oldest known rock earth  billion year old scientist think older rock destroyed earth continuing volcanism mountainbuilding erosion moon rock fill gap time earth oldest preserved rock formation solar system lava dark maria moon youngest rock old oldest rock found earth age   billion year rock lunar highland even older highland sample age   billion year moon rock preserve trace even older lunar event study rock indicate widespread melting chemical separation going within moon  billion year ago long moon formed one technique used establish early part lunar history new agedating method involving element neodymium samarium even possible first apollo sample returned combination new instrument careful protection lunar sample contamination thus make possible understand better early history moon even exciting discovery lunar rock seem record actual formation moon tiny green rock fragment collected apollo astronaut yielded apparent age  billion year time scientist think moon solar system formed early scientist identified another apollo crystalline rock ancient age piece may first material solidified oncemolten moon history moon first hundred million

looked much surface moon change slowly footprint left apollo astronaut remain clear sharp million year preserved ancient history moon sharp contrast changing earth earth still behaves like young planet internal heat active volcanic eruption mountainbuilding gone continuously far back decipher rock according new geological theory even present ocean basin le million year old formed slow separation huge moving plate make earth crust moon come explored moon three main suggestion explain existence formed near earth separate body separated earth formed somewhere else captured earth scientist still decide among three theory however learned moon formed part solar system existed individual body  billion year separation earth considered le likely many basic difference chemical composition two body absence water moon two theory still evenly matched strength weakness need data perhaps new theory origin moon settled moon told u earth might seem active inhabited earth nothing common quiet lifeless moon nevertheless scientific discovery apollo program provided new unexpected look early history planet scientist think planet formed way rapid accumulation small body large one  billion year ago moon rock contain trace process planetary creation catastrophic impact widespread melting recognize moon must also dominated earth early year billion year ago earth may looked much moon two world took different path moon became quiet earth continued generate mountain volcano ocean atmosphere life moon preserved ancient rock earth older rock continually destroyed recreated younger one earth oldest preserved rock   billion year old occur small remnant greenland minnesota africa rock like lunar lava flow age earth ancient rock granite sediment tell u earth already mountainbuilding running water ocean life time last lava flow pouring across moon way trace intense early bombardment earth destroyed record later impact remains however nearly ancient impact
