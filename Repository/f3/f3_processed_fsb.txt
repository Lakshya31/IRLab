difficult effect using power cause jedi fall deep trance remarkably slowing body function heartbeat slows breathing drop barely perceivable level fall unconscious hibernation trance serf two purpose allows jedi  play dead  also used survive food air supply low anyone come across jedi hibernation trance assumes jedi dead unless make point testing another jedi life detection power sense skill able detect force within hibernating character realize still alive hibernating character us one tenth much air someone simply sleeping hibernate week dry climate month wet one dying lack water character

difficulty easy easy  moderate  difficult  difficult  heroic  control total successful easy astrogation roll necessary enter correct route nav computer jedi fails attempt overlook obstacle sends ship downan inherently dangerous path thus instaed requiring easy astrogation total difficulty automatically difficult control roll missed five point increase difficulty heroic largely unknown application control power allows jedi plot astrogation path instead using well known sense based instinctive astrogation power instinctive astrogation control little curiosity studied theoretical jedi prominent recent memory hart daele fact daele wrote doctoral thesis subject proving highorder equation could solved certain special case situation appoximated using standard jedi mediation technique rage control difficulty difficult required power hibernation trance warning jedi us power gain dark side point note power used character consumed dark side force effect power allows character feel dread influence dark side function counterpart emptiness character must tense completely allow mindless rage dark side posse using power character appear lifeless amplifying negative aspect personality leaving face clenched rictus horror fear character must determine long wish rage enters trance barring attack arrival specific person explained jedi stay trance chosen duration jedi must make difficult control roll every four hour trance come trance jedi leaf state get  modifier force skill roll period time equal time spent rage character take son die damage every two hour trance bonus subsided like emptiness power make character oblivious surroundings move unlike emptiness however character state strongly exude dark side internal focusing provide protection character others using force add rage control roll difficulty roll another attempt use force power someone rage character hunger dehydrate twice fast normally using rage even susceptible damage strength resist damage physical energy attack state character plan extended trance need intravenous nourishment rage character le oblivious surroundings corresponding jedi emptiness example physical contact living may revive jedi must make difficult control roll cease attack offending character killed character using rage choose anticipate arrival foe must make difficult sense roll modified relationship life sense power time enter rage allow instantly awaken easy control roll expected person come within five meter person rage example preparing transfer life new clone body palpatine expects attack luke skywalker enters rage must also make difficult sense roll using life sense power anticipate luke entering clone chamber difficulty  relationship acquaintance equal plus palpatine suffers penalty make two skill us one round sense roll life sense control roll rage palpatine roll luke enters chamber palpatine instantly wake rage confronts luke  power may used preparation ritual transfer life power raged person us transfer life original body instantly totally consumed dark side often bursting unholy blue flame every three point control roll exceeded rage difficulty body damage upon explosion three meter blast radius example palpatine confronting luke clone chamber rage three hour gaining  force skill palpatine difficulty roll rolled successfully us transfer life power old body explodes damage burst flame reduce injury control difficulty moderate incapacitated character difficult mortally wounded character difficult dead character required power control pain note spending force point manner beginning round allowed also always  selfish  act save one life character might able get force point back character fighting save friend certain doom fall certainly die could even considered heroic action still involves great sacrifice effect using power jedi may call upon force reduce amount injury suffers power normally used desperation longterm repercussion power successfully used jedi loses force point injury suffered reduced wounded original injury would killed character must choose suffer permanent injury kind example luke skywalker darth vader fighting emperor chamber new death star luke batter vader defense make killing strike vader us reduce injury power expends force point wounded loses hand remain conscious control difficulty easy stunned character moderate incapacitated character difficult mortally wounded character required power control pain effect remain conscious allows jedi remain conscious even suffered injury would knock unconscious game term character power suffers kind injury lose action rest round still conscious normal character automatically pas next round character may attempt activate power must first action round jedi even dodge parry roll unsuccessful character pass immediately roll successful jedi one action declared round often character attempt control pain able remain conscious action completed jedi lapse unconsciousness unless activated control pain done something else keep character conscious resist stun control difficulty moderate time use one minute power may kept   effect resist stun allows jedi prepare body resist effect stun damage power must activated character suffered damage asuccessful result allows jedi resist stun result except unconscious normal injury unconscious result force jedi drop power considered
