tall order fill however thing help although success guaranteed company set data line must registered telecom legal nt great friend working ey data line classed fax line unless telecom specifically instructed list number public listing probably find listed fax directory available telecom equivalent phone book data line listed grab copy directory look company chance might one even find bb system registered sysop company set phone network usually plan ahead lot time get voice data line assigned close together value simply look victim voice line try number lower higher voice number chance comming something last resort scanning phone number series carrier tone take lot time expensive since cant use hardware make toll free call like usa feasable way though lot system answer first dial tone set demon dialer program dial number sit ring tone hang longer let ring accurate costly people enough time pick phone let ring  time scanner going problem either accuracy finance fancy alternative like tapping another line using phone box etc messy obtaining password infoltrating system                      method available use get system common far least successful regard amount time waisted ole front line security warfare basicaly mean physically trying guess usernamepassword pair system trying random logical combination using prior knowledge system ie default account username structure etc sophisticated sprinter great aid good idea prior knowldge username format system actually tell username invalid enter password good hacked primenets vm top system best example many system particularly new one tend weak point front line security use gain access small list found many top system finger command login used examine file mail etc without knowldege password also systat command list online user used login lot changed finger command removed still primenets weak point early version lot nonexistent running later version primo still good idea know found system updated ok prompted password old primo legitimate username typing ctrlc password give access another weak point primenets default account mainly test often need password crash system captive mode primo ctrlp pressed several time often job ctrlp pressed right spot crash primo spend lot time finding right spot every primenet came across crashable nt usually give concentrate captive communication module unix got many hole really funny make use one need get inside first dozen default choose later social engineering yes favourite one term originated usa mean bullshiting people get hand password quite willingly one attempt art one need tool mainly adult voice since teenager get nowhere ability plan conversation anticipate every responce let give example know austpac nui hard get dumb secretary give one fir find victim melbourne university library good one next get fact together ask question assistant austpac operator pick real name phone book jot number address ready needed victim give account basically stuff austpac last six digit lost need identify user talk technical bullshit structure nui billing computer stuffed arse going get kicked good idea ask person come main office know detail must suggest possibility fixing phone jerk youll get spot give number call back ie phone box around corner surprised cooperative people principal also used situation reason system operator ca nt change password another user basically introduction art social engineering took place hacked dialcom system lot yank using call alto system unfortunatelly died reason still emebarrased knew real user nt account often would yet known death account fortunatelly hard copy user list ufd series mail think good time stress importance recording every bit data get system always usefull stage future one fortunate hard disk simply save absolutelly everything online take precaution obvious reason first step find detail ie address phone number christian name rang operator give u listing augustine aproximate area deduced mail went luck unlisted number ok called cna cna like information directory used phone company emploees cna customer numberaddress think unfortunatelly never came across australian cna bet number changed rang friend mentioned mail mr maugustine worked nasa trader introduced important figure nasa organization got detail wanted ring dialcom get change password said wife germany using datexp ca nt get onto account important mail waiting naturally password changed spot information sort requested trojan horse another way getting password basically involves simulation another system login setting user take bait ie stick computer onto phone box time person likely call give person number ie changed different system faster responces thus saving online time etc computer simulate real login primitive trojan talk later tell set dialcom system important thing make sure get system stay effort would le waisted always get information mail usernames information user basically anything system offer matter insignificant may seem time deffaul password vax unix primenet dialcom                         large variety system lot got common account always good idea try hacking usernames test demo guest visitor etc using basic easilly remembered password think deffault account usefull indeed basic rundown major system vax   encounter vax trying following may prove quite successfull useruser guestguest gastgast europe fieldservice fieldtest systemmanager systemoperator systemsystem systesttest systestsystest systestuetp also try lower well upper case system translate lower upper case lucky enough get account full privs namelly systemmanager fieldservice look user name ie show user command create username simmilar format blend backround run adduser authorise program sys system directory nt think need go detail since literally hundereds good file vax system come accross captive account ie allowed direct access dcl digital command language typing nocomm prevent execution certain login file may prevent accessing dcl lower access level example login username usernocomm password user one important thing vax mentioned vax tutorial seen system equiped x gateway psipad refer basically name suggest gateway packet switched network activate type set hostx system respond node find psipad installed whether privs make use end end
