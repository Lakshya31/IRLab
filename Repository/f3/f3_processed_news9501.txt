existing wwivnet software wwivnet interface software information provided document enough anyone wishing write wwivnet interface software scratch unless writing bb nonpc platform hermes macintosh need rewrite software interface pcbased bb wwiv network since local mail processor networkexe program writes bb message base really one needing replace ment netxx program used essential supporting data file used software present detail file see wwivnet software documentation additional programming may necessary though one shell would useful executing various network program unless bb modified make call batch file could program jim wire clout make much easier shell bb modification follow step filename parenthesis program net file createdused choose system call one specified execute network callout program networkexe successful proceed step either try end processing check incoming netmail file pnet nt one end processing one run netmail packet analyzer networkexe check local mail file

file processor analyze outgoing message file pnet tossing various connection file snet znet course optimal solution possible would modify bb software export message directly wwivnet compatible mail file run network program needed without shell probably good time discus naming incoming pending netmail file mentioned step actual name pnet vary depending netxx version program generates networkexe

minortype using receiving system using software installed properly execute local mail processing process request external message local mail processor also support use  preprocessors  generally used scan local mail file certain type message local mail processor get one example jafo autosend look sub request sends message system sub new subscriber also described wwivnet software documentation naturally external message processor preprocessor generates new outgoing network message must put pnet file networkexe find process appendix mail packet compression order write wwivnet software deal compressed mail packet must pkware compression library available pkware inc  appendix cover necessary detail handling compressed mail packet make explanation easier network net handle compressed file
