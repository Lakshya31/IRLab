choice make came choosing display system computer blessedly choice made back either monochrome display adpater socalled mda solution color screen adapter cga route needle say thing simple straightforward day many choice option open purchaser upgrader pc crazy even attempt offer clarification guidance okay call crazy time choose display subsystem steve dream machine got real surprise store time spent past six week nt reconfiguring system vm desqview omniview researching probing digging best possible contemporary display solution least possible money surprisingly research uncovered truly startling fact sharing next week explore display system steve dream machine see thing like new bit display adapter generally worth dime older bit predecessor vga adapter market really register level compatible risk represents light ibm unknowable future plan see extra display memory nt buy many manufacturer device driver nt even use highest resolution mode much trouble worth pay great high resolution display given incredible variety available choice like old day may surprise know found one set choice delivers far bang buck order give conclusion proper perspective let first step back moment review technological fundamental constraint give decision meaning see going matter style display screen interface adapter use several fundamental always apply first place image displayed crt screen static image appears fact never really image displayed screen photograph computer display screen high speed camera see single bright dot light rather entire image illusion screen full information created aid incredible technology screen actually painted single madly whizzing dot light trace successive horizontal line across face display tube say  madly whizzing  exaggerating typical crt screen paint horizontal scan line face rate  inch per second  mile per hour furious speed required order fool eye believing entire image continuously displayed fact mostly displayed typical display screen consists horizontally scanned line must redrawn  refreshed  least every sixtieth second mean scanning across  line per second every second done eye perceive line continuously illuminated illusion tried hard achieve fail single dot light trace furious course change color thus tracing full screen image stored display adapter display refresh memory monochrome screen limited displaying single color dot light varies brightness whereas color display system allows dot instantaneous color varied well left number important concept order eliminate overall  refresh flicker  display screen entire screen must redrawn repainted approximately time second since scanning dot trace line left right move slowly vertically top screen downward motion referred screen vertical refresh frequency rapid horizontal left right scanning referred display horizontal refresh rate display system adventure continues seen display screen computer rely entirely upon eye persistence vision assemble illusion image screen dot composes display must redrawn refreshed least sixty time second order appear continuously illuminated well examine evolution display screen giving perspective today original color graphic adapter cga trace ancestry directly commercial television commercial tv refreshes screen exactly time per second horizontal scanning frequency  cycle per second ibm cga display utilizes timing support image generates total number horizontal scanning line traced onto screen cga system determined simply calculating many horizontal line scanned one vertical scan since

producing highly legible text yet memory prime determiner text quality number individual pixel dot available display individual character dividing total image line line text yield scanning line available per text line since cga adapter able display dot across horizontal line dividing character per line yield pixel dot horizontally per character cga technology yielded budget pixel per character since necessary separate character least one blank pixel since character taller wide cga character designed fit within rectangle dot wide dot high moment spare time graph paper try designing entire upper lower case alphabet character fit within pixel cell simple really great solution driven concern serious business computer user would unhappy appearance cga text ibm decided provide better text display alternative monochrome display adapter mda result order deliver legible character pixel required horizontally vertically cga fit character  cell  ibm monochrome display provides much higher resolution character within space changing character resolution result tremendous improvement character legibility  pixel horizontal intercharacter spacing pixel vertical spacing leaf display character feeling quite uncrowded question ibm get extra scanlines line text scanlines per line mean total active scan line compared cga scanline count increased increasing horizontal scan frequency line scanned per second decreasing overall vertical refresh rate thus allowing time scan horizontal line ibm thing create mda standard mda refreshes screen cycle per second horizontal scan rate  hertz dividing  yield scan line since required text display mda able display border ibm refresh mda screen cycle per second begin noticing flicker refresh frequency fall cycle per second ibm compensated lack vision persistence designing highly persistent green phosphor monochrome display many people immediately noticed  smeary  effect whenever ibm monochrome display scrolled text smearing created use long persistence phosphor continued glow long screen electron beam stopped refreshing region ever noticed annoying continuous flicker inexpensive clone monochrome display know clone monochrome display use le expensive standard short mediumlength phosphor  inadequate masking noticeable effect mda lower refresh rate also since flickerperception phenomenon extremely subjective many people perceive flicker others nt ive learned nt see flicker people driven nut understanding interaction horizontal vertical scan rate display resolution ready explore ega vga multisync technology role hercules graphic evolution ega seen ibm designed mda monochrome display system deliver extremely wellformed character increasing display horizontal scanning rate decreasing vertical refresh rate continuing discussion ega vga multisynchronous monitor important understand another quite well established significant display standard hercules perhaps ibm simply overlooked idea monochrome graphic altogether underestimated demand display graphic information likely though ibm felt word processing market toward targeting monochrome display system need display graphic could ibm anyone matter anticipated phenomenal effect lotus spreadsheet product would upon ibm compatible market column number indeed informative ability graphically display correlate view result spreadsheet calculation extremely useful folk hercules computer quickly recognized designed wonderful solution early support lotus became solid standard since hercules high resolution mode designed operate ibm compatible monochrome monitor horizontal sweep rate  cycle per second refresh frequency hertz could directly leverage extremely high resolution ibm designed monochrome text system hercules monochrome display resolution pixel made cga look quite sad compared side side suddenly people could readable text great looking graphic time single system ibm next move demonstrated listening user complaint low resolution cga standard also watching guy hercules make money like crazy attempting serve always mixed blessing requirement full backwards compatibility ibm enhanced graphic display ibm second generation solution rapidly became new standard industry recognizing cga system cry need better text ibm saw crank scan line count something like monochrome display however since fullcolor long persistence phosphor monitor barely affordable small country ibm knew could nt play trick getting scan line count lowering system overall refresh rate cycle per second alternative push system horizontal scanning frequency higher monochrome system would mean new ega display system would backwards compatible existing installed base scan line resolution cga software nonoptimal solution crime continually committed name backwards compatibility probably single biggest pet peeve directly account unprogrammablity intel microprocessor instruction set order achieve cga compatibility new ega system ibm invented  bisynchronous  display system inverting polarity ega monitor vertical synchronization signal ega adapter actually able switch ega monitor two separate mode cgas horizontal sweep rate  cycle per second newly invented ega horizontal rate  cycle per second  hertz rate yield cga software compatible resolution line  hertz rate result full herculestype resolution line ega graphic mode result significant herculessimilar resolution pixel since ibm seems determined kick horizontal resolution system pixel nt quite get full character separation beauty mda hercules text hand ega character resolution budget pixel significantly better cga budget allows lower case character descending tail like  g   p   q    imaged cleanly egas resulting wellformed character made people happy ega final addition cga standard provision additional color cga display could display color either two intensity bright dim ega display operating ega mode allowed three primary color red green blue mixed together four intensity therefore time time total color could displayed ibm ega display though technology passed ega monitor represented adequate backward compatible unification cga mda hercules standard ibm recognition ega shortcoming creation vga  standard  journey toward goal selecting best possible display system least possible money steve dream machine traced evolution ibm compatible display system technology
