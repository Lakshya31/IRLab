nan white powder poisonous also bit unstable treat gently lead nitrate pb contains poisonous lead water soluble body absorb quickly given chance government banned leaded paint phasing leaded gasoline stuff slowly accumulates body screw sort important innards careless lead nitrate lifetime worth damage one afternoon ammonium nitrate nh commonly used fertilizer stuff somewhat dangerous large quantity particularly get hot entire shipload material known go heated gently decomposes water nitrous oxide laughing gas farmer sometimes use blow tree stump mixing fuel oil setting gunk detonator different use potassium nitrate kno also known saltpeter commercially used diuretic animal also work oxidizing agent various pyrotechnic mixture heated provides oxygen needed make rest mixture burn potassium potassium nitrate nitrite oxygen kno  kno potassium chlorate kclo much spectacular oxidizing agent potassium nitrate yield oxygen potassium nitrate easily pyrotechnic mixture containing chemical require much le yet burn fiercely even percussion readily set mixture useful sometimes make mixture sensitive like mixture containing chemical must handled carefully potassium chlorate also poisonous potassium potassium chlorate chloride oxygen kclo  kcl aluminum dust finely divided aluminum put glass jar almost look like solid piece grey metal form flammable also seriously damage lung inhale careful stir cloud dust go without saying nt use near open flame zinc dust finely divided zinc quite flammable aluminum dust still worth handling carefully also damage lung inhaled lampblack finely divided carbon usually obtained soot manufacturing process much effective pyrotechnic mixture powdered charcoal tiny spot almost unnoticeable stick hand smear incredibly far tidy expect find black smear face hand using sulfur yellow powder used reducing agent many pyrotechnic mixture buy finely powdered form also get hard lump waste extra time grind potassium permanganate oxidizing agent somewhat le vigorous others mentioned usually used pyrotechnic mixture expensive le effective alternative case right thing nt let accidentally come contact glycerine accident happens resulting mess immediately wiped wet paper towel buried flushed toilet thrown away dry waste receptacle gum arabic white powder mixed water make glue like substance useful coating various mixture binding together solid mass sodium peroxide strange dangerous oxidizer nt let get wet nt let touch skin glycerine thick liquid chemically similar rubbing alcohol though harder get burning burn right circumstance fairly safe stuff iodine crystal pure iodine steel grey solid poisonous produses poisonous vapor heated smell similar chlorine used bleach swimming pool accidentally drop hot surface notice odor leave

saturated solution mean dissolved much chemical water possible hang paper dry sure wipe drip dry ready cut small strip light edge see different act ordinary paper ignite stubborn mixture ignite gunpowder turn ignite anything else nt dip towel potassium nitrate solution second time try make  stronger  actually make le effective fancier paper towel nt work well best result obtained cheap folded paper towel found public restroom everywhere self igniting mixture pulverize gram potassium permanganate crystal place asbestos board earthenware vessel let  drop glycerine fall onto potassium permanganate mixture eventually sizzle flare potassium permanganate oxidizing agent glycerine oxidized quickly heat generated faster dissipated consequently glycerine ignited mixture take long catch fire sometimes useful time delay needed set mixture lose patience test throw mixture away wastebasket either bury flush toilet know least one house fire started done given time stuff start burn demonstration produce nice effect sends lot poisonous fume outside make mound equal volume iodine crystal aluminum dust make small indentation top mound add drop two water move away hiss burst flame generating thick purple smoke fume iodine vapor caustic make sure upwind fire since set moisture store mixed material mix immediately plan use shred small piece newspaper place small amount sodium

either due heat percussion mixed gum arabic glue tiny dot placed match head make trick exploding match mixture coated onto   wood splinter used  load  cigar larger amount used detonator moderately light tap set making much sensitive percussion explosive already mentioned easy make take  gram sodium azide dissolve water best use water necessary separate container dissolve  gram lead nitrate using much water needed get dissolve two clear liquid mixed white precipitate lead azide settle mixture add lead nitrate solution stirring lead azide precipitate may need use note weight given convenience necessary scale give approximate proportion needed need continue mix solution precipitate form precipitate filtered rinsed several time distilled water good idea store wet form le sensitive way best store possible keep flexible plastic container wont produce sharp fragment case explosion gram time also make sure mouth container wiped clean putting lid shock removing lid enough
