data encryption standard fact sheet introduction national institute standard technology nist department commerce recently received many inquiry regarding various aspect data encryption standard de document address frequently asked question provides interested individual source additional information document designed issue new policy rather summarizes clarifies existing policy additional guidance concerning use national security agency nsa developed type ii lowcost encryption authentication device lead planned issued background issued federal information processing standard
