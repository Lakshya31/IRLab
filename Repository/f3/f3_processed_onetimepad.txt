always use onetime pad height cold war fifty sixty soviet spy usa used onetime pad communicate controller usually located inside russian embassy consulate single message cracked fbi nsa none message ever cracked used best onetime pad system still used today intelligence agency like britain mi germany bnd france dgse russia mbrf china cheng pao k onetime pad also used resistance group like

background cryptography science originally developed arab year saw publication subh ala sha volume encyclopedia written shihab aldin alqalqashandi text described transposition substitution cipher arab lightyears ahead european mathematics advanced cryptography relies heavily math european still struggling roman numeral arab already discovered principle zero word cipher derived arab word al cifr literally meaning nothing zero onetime pad system perfected first world war random key written sheet paper glued together form pad key used hence name onetime pad step create key  core onetime pad system random key key block number used transform original message plaintext coded message ciphertext begin work onetime pad system need create random key create random key need method converting alphabet character number chart illustrates workable system simple easily remembered background government agency use codebooks containing oftenused word phrase represented number example rather encrypting phrase like safe house coding clerk might simply use spy agent hand afford carry incriminating evidence like bulky codebooks use instead simplified conversion method shown spell every word full b c e f g h j k l n p q r u v w x z ready create key first write series random alphabet character hlmsezrbhpsjotdw make key easier work break block two character thus hl m ez rb hp sj ot dw use conversion table shown convert alphabet character number example h l first block hl becomes result created first onetime pad also called key normally would create much longer key enabling send number message key used use block number encrypt message would cross block used ensure use block simulate crossing block marking square would normally create two copy key provide one copy intended recipient use character x represent period plaintext step format message  suppose message want send secret would next format message block two character yielding se cr et next use conversion chart convert alphabet character number example using first block would entire string becomes see using block make text increasingly difficult anyone crack even stage guideline  rule number spell number full plaintext example becomes three six five rule negative always add emphasis word plaintext example would write agent alpha rpt available meeting tuesday rpt stand repeat rule punctuation use x period plaintext example message receivedx send infox punctuation must written full example comma rule termination end plaintext xx necessary add dummy character xx order pad message frustrate cryptanalysis conclude doublet ensuring numeric string end four digit use pointer beginning message specify key recipient decrypt text step encrypt message  need way indicate recipient key begin otherwise heshe wo nt able decrypt remember earlier example created key stroked square block already used key looked like starting position key block place string beginning message recipient know decrypt plaintext message becomes place pointer beginning string ready encrypt first write plaintext directly write key add key plaintext using fibonicci addition mean carrying example would yield plus would yield spy working sheet would look plaintext key  ciphertext encrypted message ready sent recipient sleep peacefully knowing cracked anyone except recipient decrypt message recipient simply revers calculation decrypting message  decrypt message simply reverse calculation subtract key ciphertext using fibonicci subtraction mean allow negative number add required example would yield add able subtract first block ciphertext tell recipient start key recipient working sheet look like ciphertext key plaintext  subtract first column second column third column fourth column using conversion chart described earlier recipient convert string number back alphabet character example first block convert string becomes se cr et recipient reformats become secret security  provided eavesdropper get access either

conceal key location know tampered usually mean carrying person time location security good security mean choosing private location encrypt decrypt message remember easy fbi agent local police install pinhole video camera desk choosing location creative unpredictable quick survival tip first sign surveillance must stop working desk unless absolutely sure way gain access install video surveillance equipment pinch work desk implement offsite location disposal security good security mean destroying working material encryption decryption nt leave anything around authority work usually mean shredding burning ingestion yes eat evidence saved kim philby bacon early career random mean security onetime pad system depends randomness key nt use computer generate key hand sure introduce second element randomness method throwing dice flipping coin every creating key onetime mean nt use key ever even block overlap two different message nsa cracker software shift compare ciphertext message
