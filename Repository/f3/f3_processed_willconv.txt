building right except fact would nt necessarily building right platform williams board many jumper pad cut inserted order change configuration good design standpoint one use board variety application indeed hack owes existence flexibility designed williams hardware ala make documenting hack nightmare rom board strapped others go sound board strapping option used specific game may also present due wide variety strapping variation lack documentation generally difficult tell anyone turn arbitrary board set set used hack said still simplify problem save work process  rom board hack depends rom

rom board strapped concern strapping sound board sound board strapped dozen configuration simplicity sake shall assume started one strapped use robotron joust mean probability strapped rather fool around trying modify strapping decided merely build adaptor project construction described later hacking step  stargate sound rom data come handy original stargate sound board strapped jumper rom

robotron strapped either game strapped adaptor let u use work step  let u use stargate sound rom board without work build program board  start building adaptor allow plug big eprom one socket rom
