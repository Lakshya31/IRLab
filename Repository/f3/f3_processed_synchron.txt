getting sync midi synchronization refers various technique making several timedependent device work together one example driving synths favorite keyboard  synchingup  synthesizer keep tempo track tape deck method incorporate masterslave scheme mechanism fsk chase lock midi sync  tempo relative  one device serf conductor orchestra peripheral technique smpte incorporate arbitrary format  fixed time  signal relationship tempo timing method refer  striping  process individually recording track sync signal sequence song sound taped midi sync  tempo relative  technique generally used  sequencerlike  device computer rhythm composer drive multiple midi instrument heart beat midi sync midi clock message referred midi clock midi clock sent rate clock per quarter note creating relative tempo usually expressed song position pointer spp used indicate song sequence begin andor end frequency shift keying fsk simple  tempo relative  procedure us two distinct tone form signal one tone fill tape mark occurrence clock signal tape read sync device generates clock signal every time see transition fill signal mark signal due nature digital encoding fsk written various degree clock resolution example program might use clock resolution tick per beat accommodate midi sync adjust various hardware mpu rate tick per beat unfortunately onoff nature fsk disallows spp mean syncup begging song sequence furthermore frequency sensitive fsk offer little reliability poor tape quality inconsistent speed volume distortion chase lock sync cl best describe midi sync tape unlike fsk cl rely discrete tone instead utilizes wave form allowing midi clock ssp position information read sync device whereupon sequencer responds  chasing  current sequence location indicated usually creates split second delay requiring cl individually recorded track though cl limited clock resolution tick per beat draw back greatly shadowed cl ability sequence location tape furthermore ability jump position allows recovery disturbance drop society motion picture television engineer offer  fixed time  method smpte also using analog signal smpte differs cl midi sync synchronization built upon  frame  information instead tempo relationship  frame address  describes group bit defining single location rate frame written tape determine smpte format listed used frame used motion picture frame used europe video work television scan rate frame per second frame nondrop used world wide audio sync frame drop used u video work u color television scan  frame per second term  drop  indicates selected frame periodically

manufacturer proprietary format making tape interchange impractical offering advantage random position start error recovery cl midi acceptance smpte midi time code message allows smpte frame address
