recounted baker coming one second floor nt know kind sweeping visually area come looking right left got door caught glimpse man know sudden glimpse wcr baker said oswald foot away caught glimpse would put oswald right next foyer door baker according warren commission walked foyer door saw oswald lunchroom wcr oswald continued walking thus still foot baker happened problem baker account foyer door shut window would degree angle baker probability door automatic door already closed baker looked small window however wc testimony baker suggested door  might  moving reason question word point among

withdraw rifle window casually step away oswald allegedly howlett remain window second gloat feat oswald allegedly howlett squeeze tight entrance sniper nest oswald would howlett attempt simulate even cursory effort wipe rifle many wc supporter claim rifle wiped fired specific wc apologist opine  oswald  made effort whatsoever wipe weapon fired unlikely scenario hard believe gunman situation would

gunman hurriedly tried wipe part weapon would handled firing could oswald come stair without seen roy truly wc supporter never able provide plausible answer crucial question wc claimed oswald went foyer door second two baker reached landing truly would seen door would time shut nearly shut behind oswald time baker looked simple fact matter oswald could possibly come stair without seen truly fact alone prof oswald shoot jfk moreover oswald could done thing wc said sixth floor still made secondfloor lunchroom time seen baker baker reached landing noted truly baker looking someone gunman

baker spotted least door would halfway open truly saw least half oswald body profile would plain view truly truly said would seen anyone landing area  outside  probably meant would spotted anyone outside door one leading wc supporter acknowledged point email important suggests door closed truly saw door closed truly saw oswald gone allegedly coming stair oswald would well baker view time baker reached secondfloor landing door even partially open truly saw one would expect would mentioned testimony never suggested door anything closed saw testimony suggests door fact shut reached landing                             new lonegunman theory bakeroswald encounter                             wc supporter suggested oswald got inside foyer door even truly reached landing among thing theory would require u believe alleged fleeing assassin supposedly desperate provide alibi inexplicably stood right next door truly came stair truly reached landing truly looked landing area including door truly started thirdfloor stair least arrived within foot foot stair baker came stair least couple second behind theory would appear refute baker tentative claim foyer door motion looked since door apparently closed truly saw would mean oswald unbelievably stood waited door close suicidal  second wait occurred even truly view landing would oswald waited foyer door supposedly trying give alibi getting far away stair possible would nt oswald moved away door upon hearing baker truly running stair one assumes oswald nt hear running stair surely would started move away foyer door truly came stairway door landing case oswald would visible baker baker looked foyer door window second later idea fleeing gunman would stood foyer door seems wholly implausible important mission life time would get far away stair possible correspondingly get line sight anyone might look foyer door window even implausible scenario offered wc supporter go something like oswald coming stair truly called elevator upon hearing truly holler perhaps hearing baker truly running stair oswald ducked lunchroom moment later went back foyer door see way clear continue stair hope exiting building rear door oswald went back foyer door might even begun open seeing truly turned around process starting walk back toward lunchroom baker spotted would explain baker said might seen door motion starter would oswald returned quickly foyer door would nt stood away door sight close enough hear baker truly run stair passed could gone stair hope leaving building rear exit would oswald started open door sure way clear suggested started open door truly reached landing pulled back saw andor heard truly oswald would ample time duck away door thus get sight time baker reached landing theorized oswald nt start open door merely began turn around saw truly still would time duck view time baker reached landing would nt oswald heard baker truly running stair neared landing would even gotten close foyer door wouldnt stayed away door view heard baker truly continue stair wc testimony baker indicated oswald back door spotted claim cause several problem traditional lonegunman version bakeroswald encounter also creates difficulty theory put oswald second floor truly reached landing example oswald returned foyer door started push open pulled back saw heard truly earth would bothered turn around heading back lunchroom would nt simply stepped backwards soon saw heard truly matter would nt ducked window soon saw heard truly could easily rushed back lunchroom sight baker reached landing would nt oswald heard baker truly running stair began return foyer door would nt therefore stayed away door sight heard baker truly continue stair also could oswald reached second floor quickly first place could baker truly reached elevator shaft stair oswald reached secondfloor landing oswald arrived early wc supporter suggested according wc defender oswald chamber bullet bolt sniper nest sprint across sixth floor stop momentarily literally  throw  rifle hiding place dash stair scenario would require following time line action time                             fire last shot         chamber one round        exit sniper nest        sprint foot across sixth floor rifle hiding place      stop turn face rifle hiding place throw rifle            turn around run sixthfloor stairway           dash four flight stair reach secondfloor landing   obviously scenario markedly unrealistic however assume correct accept theory oswald stair truly yelled elevator baker truly running stair second floor baker truly could reached elevator shaft soon shot fired problem associated theory assumes oswald somehow made second floor truly reached landing oswald reached second floor le second would nt continued going stair exited building rear door baker truly could even elevator shaft time would oswald bothered go secondfloor lunchroom third scenario proposed wc supporter involves idea oswald walked window rifle hiding place according theory oswald  walked briskly  allegedly fired shot would nt harold norman two men sniper nest heard grown man  walking briskly  walking quickly creates almost much noise running make yet three men nt hear sound come sniper nest shooting would nt oswald run dear life one would think would wanted get far away sniper nest quickly possible would nt run sniper nest dashed stair though walking briskly make almost much noise running make could norman supposedly superhuman hearing heard grown man speedwalking across floor anyway oswald walked briskly accept sake argument assumption movement made wc supporter advance theory would behind foyer door around second shooting assume oswald exited foyer door  second later turned around heard truly yell heard baker truly running stair number problem come mind starter heard truly yell would plenty time get back lunchroom well baker sight option assume oswald heard baker truly coming stair barely gone back foyer door baker looked important point right back square one explain truly could missed seeing oswald oswald would could visible baker time baker looked door oswald standing right next door would baker chance  spotting  door window scenario becomes even problematic baker claim oswald walking away door case door would time close nearly close behind time baker allegedly spotted turn brings u right back issue truly possibly could missed seeing oswald since oswald would least middle doorway door plainly open truly saw door truly said anyone landing area would seen judge truly testimony door shut looked door shut truly looked andor oswald ducked back door heard baker truly running stair would visible foyer door window time baker looked toward door one could desperation assume oswald stood inside door nt start move away second baker looked door idea impossible outset unless also assume oswald back inside door truly reached landing area surely oswald would stepped away door ducked saw truly arrive
