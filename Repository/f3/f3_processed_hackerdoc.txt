hacker  wadesoft march disclaimer program added world collection public domain utilites free utility therefore neglecting cost diskette price entailed distribution purpose program created programming aid help wadesoft decipher various file format wav tga file used purpose well another help gamers  cheat  well programmer best friend utility also gamers valued program program outline hacker designed four distinct goal mind four function performed either textual binary exe file categorized following manner numericcharacter search b numericcharacter search replace c numericcharacter modification file comparison numericcharacter search explained probably single useful part hacker function eye programmer allows user search entire file textual binary given byte integer word long integer sequence character upon finding occurrence specified value program display location inside file used function understand tga file format knew image pixel wide long searched  word  see  data type explained    inside file told u exact location upon acquiring knowledge program able know resolution image wanted particular one point take complete advantage tga file format numericcharacter search replace selection one want search file program asks user want replacing value located program asks replace value begin search identical value located program asks user want value particular location replaced yes answered program replaces located value desired one useful cheating game one knew dollar game could search savegame file found could replaced  numericcharacter modification searching value let u say saved game program display location finding instead searchreplace every time user wanted change money game therefore knowing exactly much money heshe time user could specify location value change change  gamer would hopefully written location inside file money stored file comparison almost always saved game file constant length would indicate gamerelated information money always stored location file comparison useful length reason program report every byte different two specified file one larger addition byte would reported making huge list meaningless difference let u say roleplaying game saved game prior changed sword axe file comparison performed two savedgame file changed would revealed user would know change byte value want axe value want sword happens change halberd perhaps made comparison best use  file modification  tactic alter value note useful create list weapon spell along associated byte value location include list program together package distribute data type explained simplified small amount  programming  knowledge required one want use program reason simple software function type file game preset location file definition known utility word user must specify type data searching data stored several different manner posted listing different data type program support virtually unfamiliar programming specifically data storage brief explanation file composed certain number byte let u take kilobyte file example k represents  byte information approximately since computerese kilo stand yield  byte number range possible number requires byte storage space saved game value searching exceed likely stored byte value number get larger say money  saved byte value probably saved something larger say word word composed two byte placed sidebyside hold number large  think make sense since largest value bytevalue multiplied give  though byte usually considered smallest unit file smaller byte one byte actually composed bit description number stored memory note larger must stored word                 please note    indicates power one want change base number base one need find   upper row add number represented would      notice element word bit mean two byte sidebyside described called  word  said  largest number could represented word true assume   cell get  missing   number thus store  number largest  data type stored byte stored bit smallest biggest byte character ascii ascii word  integer  long integer bil bil using program throughout documentation several explanation example none formalized present one formal example cheating origin privateer quite popular game thought show  help  along game load saved game check see much money let u say credit exactly quit game load hacker best place hacker path statement access anywhere though required main menu choose option  long int  know lot money assume information stored long integer see table program prompt name file enter ask want search file say yes knew location byte modify would say utility ask want search enter program want replace value find enter yes want actually change money ask desired value enter  program begin scan file match found program tell found occurrence ask want replace value desired quantitiy cash entered previously yes change made hit   made good money without much effort generally information related character rather map game stored beginning file second third match made  probably fluke generally best accept first occurrence ignore following one contacting wadesoft wadesoft moment small sharewareoriented company
