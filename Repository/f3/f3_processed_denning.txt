picture hacker concern discourse hacking take place initial finding suggest hacker learner explorer want help rather cause damage often high standard behavior finding also suggest discourse surrounding hacking belongs least gray area larger conflict experiencing every level society business information age many computer literate conflict idea information owned idea law enforcement first fourth amendment hacker raised serious issue value practice information society based finding recommend work closely hacker suggest several action might taken introduction world crisscrossed many different network used deliver essential service basic necessity  electric power water fuel food good name network publicly accessible hence vulnerable attack yet virtually attack disruption actually

evolutionary process stallman asked hacker whether system accessible information free said ok system closed information mainly confidential information individual accessible make distinction information security technology eg de confidential information protected technology arguing former accessible said information hoarding inefficient slows evolution technology also said system open idle resource wasted one hacker said high cost communication hurt growth information economy view information sharing seem go back least far th th century samuelson samuelson note  drafter constitution educated enlightenment tradition shared era legacy faith enabling power knowledge society well individual  writes current copyright law protect expression information information based belief unfettered widespread dissemination information promotes technological progress similarly patent law protect device process information cite two recent court case court reversed historical trend treated information ownable property raise question whether entering information age information source greatest wealth outgrown enlightenment tradition coming treat information property society knowledge said power drake expressed particular concern see growing information gap rich poor would like see information individual made public although could still owned like think company would actually find advantage share information noted ibm disclosure pc allowed developer make product computer adobe disclosure font helped compete applemicrosoft deal recognizes current political framework difficult make information public complicated structure built top assumption certain information kept secret cite defense policy founded secrecy military information example hacker say want access information computing network resource order learn levy levy landreth landreth note hacker intense compelling interest computer learning many go computer profession hacker break system order learn system work landreth say hacker want remain undiscovered stay system long possible devote time learning break lock security mechanism system background system programming varies considerably one hacker wrote  hacker see security hole take advantage destroy information steal think activity would analogous someone discovering method acquiring information library becoming excited perhaps

student given access real computing power taught use power responsibly describes program created public high school massachusetts period  installed pdp let student teacher carry administration system harvey assessed putting burden dealing problem malicious user student powerful educational force also noted student skill interest password hacker discouraged activity also wanted keep trust colleague order could acquire  superuser  status system harvey also make interesting analogy teaching computing teaching karate karate instruction student introduced real adult community given access powerful deadly weapon time taught discipline abuse art harvey speculates reason student misuse power know trusted something important want live trust harvey applied principle set school system acm panel endorsed harvey recommendation proposing threetiered computing environment local districtwide nationwide network recommended computer professional participate effort mentor role model also recommended outside school government industry encouraged establish regional computing center using donated recycled equipment student apprenticed local company either parttime continuing basis periodic basis following suggestion felsenstein felsenstein  hacker league  league analogous amateur radio relay league established make contributed resource available educational purpose drake said liked recommendation said hacker given access powerful system public account system would supervise also suggested computer resource center established lowincome area order help poor get access information perhaps hacker could help run center teach member community use facility one colleague suggested cynically hacker would use teach poor hack rich people system hacker responded saying ridiculous hacker would teach people break system rather use computer effectively afraid addition hacker spoke given illegal activity said stopped got engaged work geoff goodfellow richard stallman reported given hacker account system manage hacker misused trust granted perhaps university could consider providing account precollege student basis recommendation teacher parent student might challenged work homework problem assigned course explore interest student strongly dislike inflexibility classroom learning might excel environment allows learn much way hacker done thrill excitement challenge one hacker wrote  hacker understand something basic computer enjoyed know none hack money hack frighten company hack anything fun  word another hacker  hacking ultimate cerebral buzz would come home another dull day school turn computer become member hacker elite whole different world condescending adult judged talent would first check private bulletin board people like would hang see news community trade info people across country would start actually hacking brain would going million mile hour id basically completely forget body would jump one computer another trying find path target rush working puzzle coupled high discovery many magnitude intensified go along adrenaline rush illicit thrill something illegal every step made could one would bring authority crashing edge technology exploring past spelunking electronic cave nt supposed  hacker spoke made similar statement fun challenge hacking spin magazine dibbel reporter julian dibbell speculated much thrill come danger associated activity writing  technology lends cloakanddagger drama   hacker already living world covert action nothing game child played  eric corley corley characterizes hacking evolved form mountain climbing describing effort construct list active mailbox voice messaging system writes  suppose main reason wasting time pushing button simply make list something supposed first person accomplish  said interested obtaining account system gordon meyer say found recurring theme  arent supposed able   one hacker said working antiviral programming said almost much fun breaking system intellectual battle virus author ethic avoiding damage hacker spoke said malicious hacking morally wrong said hacker intentionally malicious concerned causing accidental damage asked drake responsibility person pc modem reply included erasing modifying anyone else data causing legitimate user system problem hacker say outraged hacker cause damage use resource would missed even result unintentional due incompetence one hacker wrote  always strived damage inconvenience people possible never ever ever delete file one first command new system disable delete file command  hacker say unethical give password similar securityrelated information person might damage recent incident hacker broke bell south downloaded text file emergency service hacker say intention use knowledge break sabotage system according emmanuel goldstein goldstein file even contain information break system hacker also said breakins unethical eg breaking hospital system wrong read confidential information individual steal classified information said wrong commit fraud personal profit although computer security professional often disagree hacker constitutes damage ethical standard listed sound much like hacker ethic differs standard adopted computer security community hacker say unethical break many system use idle computer communication resource download system file order learn goldstein say hacking wrong stealing uncovers design flaw security deficiency goldstein brian reid speculates hacker ethic may come raised properly civilized member society appreciating rule living society one hacker responded  brought properly mean would say good keep mind business others might argue healthy explore take risk curious discover  brian harvey harvey note many hacker adolescent adolescent le developed stage moral development adult might see effect action hurt others larry martin martin claim parent teacher press others society aware responsibility contribute instilling ethical value associated computer use could consequence youth computing field many people still computer illiterate cultural norm may lagging behind advance technology growing dependency technology business society hollinger lanzakaduce speculate cultural normative message use abuse computer technology driven adaption criminal law hollingerlanzakaduce mainly last decade also speculate hacking may encouraged process becoming computer literate colleague say hacker irresponsible one hacker responded  think strong indication amount responsibility shown actually damaging incident known  must overlook difference ethic also reflect difference philosophy information information handling resource whereas hacker advocate sharing seem advocating ownership property difference also represent opportunity examine ethical behavior practice information sharing protection example one hacker wrote  accept morally wrong copy proprietary software however think morally wrong charge program around k long  hence shall go ethical point raised hacker closely simple case good mature u bad immature hacker teaching hacker list rule many computer professional argue moral question analogy eg see martin martin analogy used justify judgement hacker action unethical breaking system compared breaking house downloading information using computer telecommunication service compared stealing tangible good say hacker situation someone break house objective steal good often irreplaceable property often damaged process contrast hacker break system objective learn avoid causing damage downloaded information copied stolen still exists original system moreover noted earlier information traditionally regarded property dibbel dibbel say software industry phone company claim loss billion dollar piracy talking good disappear shelf could sold often say breaking system implies lack caring system owner authorized user one hacker say ease breaking system reveals lack caring part system manager protect user company asset failure part vendor warn manager vulnerability system estimated success rate getting  without spending hour one target system another hacker say see message vendor notifying manager manager fail take action richard pethia cert computer emergency response team report seldom see case malicious damage caused hacker breakins nevertheless disruptive system user administrator want sure nothing damaged cert suggests site reload system software secure backup change user password order protect possible back door trojan horse might planted hacker pethia also noted prosecutor generally called government site called nongovernment site increasing frequency pethia say breakins also generate loss trust computing environment may lead adoption new policy formulated panic management edict severely restrict connectivity outside system brian harvey say hacker cause damage increasing amount paranoia turn lead tighter security control diminish quality life user hacker respond point saying scapegoat system adequately protected say paranoia generated illfounded fear medium distortion return point later security need oppressive keep hacker mainly making sure password system default wellchosen pethia say intruder seem disruptive prove point system vulnerable security personnel incompetent  nice say bad thing hacker  ny time john markoff markoff wrote hacker claimed broken cliff stoll system said upset stoll portrayal hacker  cuckoo egg  stoll markoff reported caller said  stoll going hate hacker gave pretty much onesided view hacker   cuckoo egg  capture much popular stereotype hacker criminologist jim thomas criticizes presenting simplified view world one everything spring force light u darkness hacker thomas claim stoll fails see similarity activity eg monitoring communication  borrowing  monitor without authorization shutting network access without warning lying get information want hacker point stoll use pejorative word  varmint  describe hacker stoll quote colleague  technically skilled ethically bankrupt programmer without respect others work  privacy destroying one two program trying wreck cooperation build network  stoll p thomas writes  intellectual level stoll provides persuasive simplistic moral imagery nature right wrong provides  lay reader  would seem compelling justification statute severe penalty computer underground troublesome two reason first lead mentality social control law enforcement social phase would argue already overcontrolled second invokes punishment model assumes stamp behavior object apprehend convict sufficient number violator  little evidence punishment long run reduce given offense research gordon meyer suggests criminalization may fact contribute growth computer underground  public image treatment hacker express concern negative public image identity noted earlier hacker often portrayed irresponsible immoral one hacker said  government propaganda spreading image best subhuman depraved criminally inclined morally corrupt low life need prove activity accused crashing system interfering life support equipment robbing bank jamming line morally abhorent u general public  public identity individual group generated part action group interacting standard community observing action account difference hacker public image say one explanation may different standard outside hacking community simple act breaking system regarded unethical many use pejorative word like  vandal   varmint  reflect discrepency ethic even word  criminal  carry connotation someone evil hacker say criminal sense katie hafner note robert morris convicted launching internet worm likened terrorist even though worm destroy data hafner distortion event reference potential threat also create image person dangerous regarding incident hacker downloaded file bell south goldstein reported  quickly headline screamed hacker broken system interfering emergency telephone call police one newspaper report said indication anyone died injured result intrusion relief bad nt true  goldstein fact hacker involved text file broken system dollar loss attributed hacking incident also often highly inflated thomas meyer thomasmeyer say rhetoric depicting hacker dangerous evil contributes  witch hunt  mentality wherein group first labeled dangerous enforcement agent mobilized exorcise alleged social evil see current sweep hacker part reaction broader fear change rather actual crime committed hacker say particularly concerned computer security professional system manager appear understand hacker interested concern hacker say system manager treat like enemy criminal rather potential helper task making system secure may reflect manager fear hacker well responsibility protect information system stallman say stranger encounter using account likely chip shoulder past attribute harsh enforcer mentality adopted establishment say network system manager start little trust hostile attitude toward stranger stranger deserve one hacker said system manager show lack openness want learn stallman also say law make hacker scared communicate anyone even slightly  official  person might try track hacker arrested drake raised issue whether law could differentiate malicious nonmalicious hacking support  kinder gentler  relationship hacker computer security people fact many state california initially passed computer crime law excluded malicious hacking later law amended include nonmalicious action hollingerlanzakaduce hollinger lanzakaduce speculate amendment new law catalyzed mainly medium event especially report  hacker  movie  war game  created perception hacking extremely dangerous even perception based fact hacker say want help system manager make system secure would like manager recognize use knowledge design flaw outsider threat problem landreth landreth suggests way system manager approach hacker order turn colleague goodfellow also suggests befriending hacker goodfellow john draper cap n crunch say would help system manager operator phone company switch could coopererate tracing hacker without bringing law enforcement authority drake suggests giving hacker free access exchange helping security suggestion also heard several hacker drake say current attitude treating hacker enemy conducive solution belittling cause problem asked hacker whether interested breaking system rule  game  changed instead threatened prosecution invited leave  calling card  giving name phone number method breaking exchange would get recognition point vulnerability discovered interested playing one hacker said would prefer monetary reward since supporting system manager interested trying could post welcome message inviting hacker leave card approach could advantage letting hacker contribute security system allowing manager quickly recognize potentially malicious hacker since unlikely leave card perhaps hacker given opportunity make contribution outside underground dampen desire pursue illegal activity several hacker said would like able pursue activity legally income like breaking system research computer security figuring protect vulnerability say would like position permission hack system goodfellow suggests hiring hacker work tiger team commissioned locate vulnerability system penetration testing baird infosystems safeguard inc security consulting firm report employed hacker several assignment baird say hacker violate trust trust client performed outstanding manner baird belief system vulnerability better identified employing people exploited system one hacker suggested setting clearinghouse would match hacker company could use expertise maintaining anonymity hacker ensuring confidentiality record another hacker describing incident discovered privileged account without password said  others wish way hacker give information like responsible source hacker given credit helping someone told hacker really think know  would freak run screaming s secret service fbi eventually person found would caught hauled away crazy charge could accept hacker trying help  clearinghouse could also provide type service hacker also interested security policy issue drake expressed concern handle information computer security vulnerability argues better make information public cover pretend exist cite cert illustrate approach workable hacker however argue restricting initial dissemination flaw customer user drake also expressed concern role government particularly military cryptography argues nsa opinion cryptographic standard taken large grain salt code breaking role security specialist opposed hiring hacker security work eugene spafford urged people business company hire convicted hacker work security area acm say  like known arsonist install fire alarm  law person convicted done nothing break system serious damage ie  computer arson  necessary many colleague admit broken system past eg geoff goodfellow goodfellow brian reid frenkel reid quoted saying knowledge gained breaking system kid frequently called help catch people break spafford say time changed method entering field longer socially acceptable fails provide adequate training computer science computer engineering spafford however observed many hacker considerable knowledge telecommunication data security operating system programming language network cryptography challenging policy hire competent people sound character rather challenging strict policy us economic pressure close field activity person convicted breaking system enough company responsible behavior employee hacker considered employment based competency character people called stricter penalty hacker including prison term order send strong deterrent message hacker john draper incarcerated activity argues practice make problem worse told forced threat teach inmate knowledge communication system belief prison sentence serve spread hacker knowledge career criminal said never approached criminal outside prison inside prison control one hacker said clamping hobbyist underground left criminal underground said without hacker uncover system vulnerability hole left undiscovered utilized likely cause real damage goldstein argues existing penalty already way proportion act committed reason computer goldstein say kevin mitnick committed crime similar committed without computer would classified mischief maker maybe fined trespassing instead put jail without bail goldstein craig neidorf publisher editor electronic newsletter  phrack  face year fine  receiving editing transmitting downloaded text file
