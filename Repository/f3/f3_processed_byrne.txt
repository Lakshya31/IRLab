black queen initially move piece indicated giving shorthand piece followed square coming followed square end example move white knight closest king would ngf special situation capture indicated  x  instead usual   also shorthand pawn used movement pawn simply indicated giving starting square followed ending square ee background robert byrne strong grandmaster one top player world early participated semifinal world championship deep thought calculates position rate  position per second give tremendous ability navigate position require broad calculation deep thought white game cc  opening aim strong player control center whether piece pawn player much better control center square e e opponent able use control launch attack either side board opponent cramped unable match flexibility case dt choose advance c pawn give control square although immediately free diagonal development either bishop would case  dd  ee  gg black move g pawn allowing develop bishop g square development would place bishop strong diagonal nbc white develops knight strong square control important e square conjunction c pawn white significant control square notice white first moved knight c pawn would blocked would unable participate battle central square white delaying moving center pawn e pawn pawn preferring instead see opponent intention visavis pawn control center  bfg byrne likewise simply place bishop good diagonal commit center pawn yet note black strongly control dark square white control light white square  gg white prepares intensify pressure e square putting bishop g process putting bishop g g b b square nestled behind triangle pawn called  fianchettoing    ee black finally strike center pawn firmly control square preventing dt moment advancing pawn control come cost course since black longer option contesting white control square making move ee since pawn advanced byrnes strategy wellaccepted attempt defeat dt tactic since healthy respect machine calculative power trying get position ability form longrange plan based hopefully byrne locked pawn structure machine disadvantage machine unable form longrange positional plan bfg white also intensifies pressure square control certainly possible move opening  book  series preprogrammed move computer  think  yet  nbc black develops piece beginning sound monotonous control   dark square far good  dd white play seemingly meek move two reason first dt want open line potential development queen bishop newly opened diagonal second white want solidify pawn chain edc reduce possibility black playing move ee point white played king knight square f would force knight move white would lose time repositioning   ff black play aggressively increase control e time like grandmaster decides long range plan side chance lie well white control currently queenside square bishop pointing direction pawn c black hand morecontrol kingside try  mix  slow moving game advisable try mix thing area control square piece since opponent able fight strongly due local disadvantage  ee white get little control bck square block queen bishop also creating weakness light square kingside area example bishop g disappear black could infiltrate pices white square lack pawn protection  ngf black develops knight good square prepares castle nge  white develops knight somewhat le influential square f well since white person computer really  afraid  move f would active square white however probably  see  point black might play move ee forcing knight move would uncomfortable since nt great square move also white want keep diagonal open king bishop long possible computer  rewarded  move evaluation algorithm move give maximum pice mobility control square   oo mean  castle  protective move occurs game side two piece rook king move simultaneously advantage move king usually placed greater safety rook le mobilized concept important game object game mate opponent king king stay e file likely catch death cold central line opened point usually better castle sooner rather later since later might late move mean king occupies square g rook occupies square f ff white strike black control center move black capture playing exf white would capture back exf black control dark square would reduced disadvantage move white e pawn lack protection brother square around kingside weakened black fianchettoed king position hand relatively safe   dd black solidifies pawn chain give e pawn greater support also open diagonal queen bishop threatening play bce contesting white control light square center qdb bad move first move queen carefully considered queen strongest piece board radiates power wherever placed dt right idea pressurize queenside idea carried pawn march starting rab bb bb queen vulnerable attack black minor piece would retreat dt probably wanted threaten b pawn stop bishop developed also lured potential resulting check cc black next move remove check possibility   kgh king go corner safe snuggly place oo white castle king g rook f   nce black reposition knight control prepare possible pawn control cc  cc dubious course bgxb apparently winning pawn rab pinning bishop queen winning next move   cc black establishes pawn control cxd move white permit black potential pressuring pawn since pawn open file   qdxd white pawn attacked still face interesting problem develop queen bishop fxe  dubious deep thought want many computer including mephisto xl take tactical way nt realize e pawn subject attack along e file either pawn move square front former controlled becomes weak example white point play dd e square becomes weak byrne never quite get chance however  qdxe black concern find good square put queen knight e begin process pressuring e pawn nef knight find square attacking anything really suspect dt main concern stop byrne playing bce sometime next move would force white queen move   gg force knight move away also play loosens pawn cover surrounding black king weakens pawn protection f pawn nfh white thereby gain tempo attacking g pawn knight requires tempo redeploy human would found humiliating retreat back e though computer nt benefit move however protect g pawn black must move pawn part circumference pawn guarding king weakening f pawn continue require attention   hh light square around black king pretty weak read guarded pawn anymore bcd white make motion least move queen bishop last rank sort development move connect white rook premits queen rook participate game   bb black would think black pressure central white pawn weak f pawn consider also oneof prime concern must develop queen bishop also queen rook black move queen bishop right away would lose b pawn white queen black could played qec protect b pawn want somehow play bce would gain tempo attacking white queen played qec bishop could never move e black first play bb moving pawn square protected black  pawn freeing bishop move dark side pawn move however white king bishop pressing c pawn fresh weakness created black camp qba good move queen voluntarily relocates time grabbing nice diagonal leading knight e find soon remarkably berift protection   aa black change mind move bce would accomplish much though would mean bishop would continue protect f pawn instead black plot play bca would attack white pawn behind rook b pawn weakened white seizes fresh weakness na b pawn attacked move square c becomes available posting white knight   rb pawn must protected alternative great raa totally awkward qec give white chance pile c pawn rac note qeb would lose knight e qhite queen recurrent theme next move nhf white take moment relocate knight better square protects pawn anticipation black next move also want king quite exposed possible check   bca bishop come bdc bishop find active square control important center square opposes bishop long diagonal also laying foundation little combination   qee knight must protected bcxa black simply recapture bishop bxa white play nac attacking black queen bishop black queen square go keep protecting bishop knight e therefore one fall white pawn complication    baxd order come pawn desperado complication nfxd surprise white play qaxd seems necessary order stop black playing qexe check followed taking bishop   bxa instead black carry  threat  playing qexe check bxa sequence would go  qexecheck kgh bxa rae followed rexe white end piece ahead rae white take time protect e pawn future square c great spot either white knight   ned black finally move accursed knight central square white piece find much greater scope nac   black queen attacked black must give way finally black pawn weaker white white bishop strong   qec square f pawn still protected knight jump strong square attacking weakend light square kingside nde white threatens neg check winning rook f knight would winning advantage material since knight worth pawn rook worth pawn   rbb first glance incomprehensible since allows white carry threat neg check black
