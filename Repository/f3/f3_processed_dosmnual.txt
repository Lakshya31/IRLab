label face left care floppy disk floppy disk reliable storage device require care simple rule never touch disk surface exposed window store disk cool dry place disk storage box ideal keep floppy disk away magnetic field motor telephone electrical device handle disk care avoid bending writing disk label use felttip pen label attached disk avoid excess pen pressure keep floppy disk protective sleeve whenever disk drive store backup copy important disk away work space problem occur program data another location retrieved avoid spilling anything floppy disk keep coffee beverage away computer work area never remove disk drive drive light cause lose data disk page avoid subjecting floppy disk static electricity ground touching grounded object walking carpet static air page hard disk drive hard disk drive hand permanent remove disk remains drive time typical hard disk drive hold megabyte data allows store equivalent floppy disk single hard disk drive hard disk drive typically named c computer probably start hard disk drive disk drive drive b hard disk pretty much take care one exception hard disk automatic head parking feature see owner manual use program supplied drive park head whenever turn computer owner manual came drive provide information along name parking program page file filename every program computer data stored file disk drive thing need know file file must unique filename may already familiar structure filename rundown filename made two part file name extension let look typical file commandcom file name extension file name may character long may contain letter number separated extension period decimal point extension character also made letter number combined two part filename help identify particular file choose filename file carefully help find file later certain extension reserved do specific type file com exe ba bat reserved extension used ordinary file certain punctuation character used filename others simplicity sake avoid use punctuation character filename do command going discus individual do command fact command structure two basic type do command internal command command like copy del type stored computer memory used anytime see system prompt many mostused command fall category page external command group command stored disk use either insert do floppy disk change directory hard disk contains do external command see directory section manual detail example external command include format diskcopy chkdsk section manual devoted command tell whether command internal external command take several form separate form used including various parameter command parameter discussed command indicate mark example command attached parameter dirw do command must activated pressing enter key typing command note type do command either upper lower case letter rest manual present do command alphabetical order common command included information command see do manual page chdir chdir internal command computer hard disk drive program data drive may stored subdirectory marked subdirectory check type dir c prompt subdirectory shown like filename dir place extension chdir command allows change sub directory need use program subdirectory example change subdirectory called wp type command shown chdir sp wp enter command abbreviated cd cd sp wp enter executing command wp directory go back main directory type following command chdir sp  enter chdir enter cd sp  enter cd enter command given subdirectory act directory chkdsk chkdsk external command chkdsk command allows check disk computer look bad sector disk also tell much memory available computer use command time time check important floppy disk check hard disk drive problem begin see bad sector hard disk drive number bad sector start increase hard disk drive may developing problem remember hard disk drive bad sector watch increase page example check disk drive use following command chkdsk sp enter check hard disk chkdsk sp c enter substitute drive name note since external command must insert do disk drive chdir directory contains do external command hard disk cl cl internal command cl command clear computer screen move system prompt top screen example clear screen type following command cl enter copy copy internal command principal use copy command copy file one disk directory another use simple example copy file letterdoc drive drive b enter following command copy sp letterdoc sp b enter copy letterdoc drive b change name drive b letterdoc type following copy sp letterdoc sp b letterdoc enter page copy letterdoc wp subdirectory drive c drive b use format copy sp c wpletterdoc sp b enter wildcards do also allows copy one file two symbol called wildcards allow specify group file wildcards indicates group character indicates single character example copy file extension doc drive drive b use command copy sp doc sp b enter copy file drive drive b copy sp sp b enter note wildcards copy file within subdirectory unless subdirectory path statement including subdirectory copy letterdoc letterdoc etc drive drive b copy sp letter doc sp b enter note copying blank diskette must format diskette first see format command copy command along do command used path statement copy file subdirectory see section path command information del erase del erase internal command command identical used interchangeably delete file disk use carefully example delete letterdoc drive b page del sp b letterdoc enter similarly delete letterdoc directory wp drive c del sp c wpletterdoc enter use wildcard character del erase way copy command example delete file extension doc drive b del sp b doc enter delete file drive b del sp b enter time use wildcard delete file computer ask sure yn check sure want delete file disk type press enter key copy command path information added drive specification needed caution use extreme care using wildcards del erase command pay special attention drive name designated possible inadvertently delete file hard disk single keystroke careful dir dir internal command dir command allows see list file stored disk along filename also provides information file example see list file drive dir sp enter page see list file along size file byte date time data last entered file addition amount space left disk displayed sometimes disk file displayed screen using dir command cause file scroll top screen faster read avoid add parameter p example dir sp b p enter do fill screen file information print bottom screen press key continue press key another screenfull data displayed continues entire directory presented another option dir see list file disk arranged multiple column without file size information dir sp w enter note use dir command frequently check file disk keep track amount disk space available diskcopy diskcopy external command use diskcopy make exact duplicate floppy disk use command floppy disk drive typically drive drive b copy disk single drive computer diskcopy enter computer ask place source diskette drive press enter pressing enter key computer read data disk ask place target diskette drive press enter page remove original disk replace blank disk press enter data copied onto blank disk computer two floppy disk drive diskcopy sp sp b enter see following place source diskette drive place target diskette drive b strike key ready place original disk drive blank disk drive b press key computer make copy process complete see make another copy yn enter start process n return system prompt note new disk formatted diskcopy automatically format copying caution make sure second disk contain data since diskcopy command destroy data disk use diskcopy command drive b format format external command write data onto floppy disk must formatted hold data do command automatically format disk drive format sp enter see screen insert new diskette drive press enter ready page place unformatted disk drive press enter key do format disk make ready accept data process complete see format complete format another yn want format diskette press process repeat press n return system prompt caution like diskcopy format destroys data disk use caution formatting disk warning version do format act drive c hard disk drive data hard disk destroyed always indicate drive formatted check typing carefully using command mkdir mkdir internal command mkdir command allows create new subdirectory example create new subdirectory called chapter drive c mkdir sp c chapter enter create subdirectory within subdirectory example create subdirectory chapter directory novel drive c mkdir sp c novelchapter enter already directory want place subdirectory need character example used chdir cd command move novel subdirectory create chapter subdirectory like mkdir sp chapter enter note abbreviate mkdir command md example md sp chapter enter page caution certain know directory using simplified form command otherwise may create subdirectory unwanted place avoid confusion use full format including drive name first second example path path internal command computer hard disk drive many program use along data file stored subdirectory normally change directory chdir cd command get access file do provides another method path command command allows tell do look file instruct computer look several place file name another command program example tell do look wordprocessing program file novel subdirectory used example part manual path sp wpnovel enter using format do automatically search wp directory novel subdirectory file give command directory suppose number program use frequently different subdirectory following name db wp  mail sale addition subdirectory novel wp directory business personal mail directory following command allow access program listed path sp db wpnovel  mailbusinesspersonal sale enter notice main directory separated semi colon subdirectory directory specified backslash character note path specify exist do give following message path page do find file specify subdirectory message appear bad command filename either case check path command make certain correct type path enter without information do display current path designation note along directory name also include drive name path command use feature make do look floppy drive file ren ren internal command use ren command change name file example change file letterdoc letterdoc ren sp letterdoc sp letterdoc enter rmdir rmdir internal command rmdir abbreviated form rd remove subdirectory disk removing directory however file directory must deleted del erase command example remove wp directory hard disk enter following series command cd sp wp enter del sp enter cd sp  enter rmdir sp wp enter page caution certain really want delete file directory file wish save copy another directory floppy disk deleting type type internal command use type command view content file monitor command useful ascii file meaning file contain text excludes program file well file created word processing program example see file autoexecbat drive type sp autoexecbat enter also specify path command see file letterdoc wp directory drive c type sp c wpletterdoc enter note command scroll file screen fast read special utility program available let see file one screen time file public domain program available without charge public domain software supplier page error message make mistake entering command another type problem occurs do place error message screen following common message see suggestion correcting error provided following message bad command file name do find file command entered check typing path specified error disk drive error abort ignore retry do detected error disk drive often message appears forgotten insert floppy disk drive failed close door correct problem press r retry pressing return system prompt message appear trying access hard disk drive  stop get help someone know system well file copied onto tried copy file filename drive check command file found do ca nt find file specified check typing make sure given correct path format failure error occured using format command do provide explanation error message take appropriate corrective measure insufficient disk space disk working enough space hold data replace new formatted disk repeat operation page insufficient memory computer enough memory operation named consider expanding system memory size memory expansion relatively inexpensive invalid disk drive drive name specified exist computer check typing invalid number parameter mistyped command specified information acceptable do check command error many error message may see screen information error consult do manual page computer crash matter careful time computer get confused usually happens keyboard lock nothing type effect problem sometimes occur including drive wo nt stop running using commercial software problem infrequent happen time time often lock system experimenting public domain software le bugfree commercial program four way get locked system try order shown hold ctrl key press scroll lockbreak key often get program return system prompt youre back
