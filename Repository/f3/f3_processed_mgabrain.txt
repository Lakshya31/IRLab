machine cognitive enhancement compound already exist megabrain described variety device show evidence enhancing cognition summary several recent study suggesting ce device clear cognitionboosting effect see  research update  elsewhere issue book also mentioned cognitionenhancing effect neurochemical vasopressin mshacth  since mind magnifying drug emerged well even astonishing evidence ability amplify learning memory thinking nt know best use together even whether used together want find problem many aware extremely difficult interested performing research effect brain machine obtain necessary funding support mainstream science particularly element control doling grant fund support research many university institution engaged research seem little interest investigating machine research done usually involves therapeutic application device rather induction peak performance brain state hand huge amount money spent research cognition enhancing drug much research done big pharmaceutical company racing develop patentable memory enhancement drug obtain fda approval compound since fda primarily oriented toward treating disease medical context shown much interest giving approval drug simply improve people memory boost intelligence pharmaceutical company directing effort toward gaining approval cognitionenhancement drug treatment medical problem alzheimer disease multipleinfarct dementia senility since financial analyst estimate cognitive drug could quickly produce sale well billion dollar year u alone ultimately outsell antibiotic tranquilizer competition fierce company mood investigate way substance might work synergistically combination substance mechanism mind machine also since effort directed toward drug patentable company little interest exploring cognition enhancement property substance patented vitamin c good example controlled study healthy individual tested level vitamin c iq higher level vitamin averaged point higher iq lower

unpatentable substance dhea rumored demonstrated recent study success among thing treating aid well cognition enhancement however drug company involved experiment apparently trying conceal discovery dhea develop variant patentable ie commercial value obtained court order forbidding scientist charge study even speak anyone matter met guinea pig u megabrain report concluded really want research mindmachine mindfood interaction better start thus ask join u series survey test assessment designed explore interaction brain machine cognitive enhancement compound say advising take cognition enhancement substance describe advise take compound advise use mind machine anything enhance mental functioning high level mental functioning exceedingly dangerous frightening unpredictable side effect individual socrates jesus galileo discovered however reason believe many nature curious given exploration even experimentation  fact many already making use cognitionboosting nutrient seems clear u information would interest value rest u also clear hundred even thousand information gathering together synthesize analyze begin search trend tendency proclivity perhaps even make important connection first part survey intended openended exploration rather rigorous scientific study attempt confirm existing hypothesis hope solid conclusion hard data rather discover delineate interesting avenue future research later issue report early survey result possible  though guarantee  investigating subjective response hope receive megabrain report reader discover trend use information guide u designing focused study part two survey example might receive many report effect piracetam amplified used light sound device could plan focus deeply particular machinecompound interaction

day two day third day blue suddenly started feeling great energetic fast etc feeling similar caffiene without much adrenal response keeping account heard music became intense strong desire play loud tried playing guitar seemed come easily unfortunately eventually went away nt similar experience since although havent pushed much seems verbal memory vocabulary increased slightly keeping research clear difference one even exists dmae tell dmae work advertised two main effect seems slowly build stimulation constant persistant seems regulate reduce need sleep effect appeared taking mg dmaeday
