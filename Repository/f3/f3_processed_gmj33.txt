correctly tell u fix  cammy  special move spear kick  kick spinning backhand punch crescent kick  kick piledriving suplex pileplex  fierce kick throwing distance back suplex  fierce punch throwing distance ariel throw  medium kick comment spear kick cammy launxhes horizontally close ground opponent actually worst move used combo easily problem horrible recovery time dealt short spear kick limit range opponent recovering block recovering kick also place maximum distance opponent also go half way across screen stopping used stop projectile like blanka honda best used defensive maneuver spinning backhand look like quick spin followed guile backhand capability hitting twice great deal damage secondly cammy spinning heals invincible perfect timing since vulnerable point used like balrog tap dodge fireball difficult time move far forward probably want use jab spinning backhand otherwise end within sweeping distance move fairly slow used correctly deadly crescent kick basically dragon punch foot best move trajectory wider ken fierce dp also invincible except kenryu dragon punch going intital frame vulnerable though cant used exactly like dp combo ken ryu throw fireball following  spinning backhand short kick crescent kick hit combo guile show sonic boom dee jay show ace rusher  spinning backhand crescent kick hit combo overall cammy one best new character game according people good speed airpriority rival chun li seems played style chun li added advantage uppercutlike kick great antiair defense also  thawk  special move mexican typhoon full degree joystick punch aka phi slamma jamma like zangief spinning pile driver condor dive jump three punch tomahawk buster  punch face smash  fierce punch face chop  roundhouse throw medium punch comment mexican typhoon hawk grab plams head like basketball jump air windmill air degress slam ground head first want impress hell everyone around move pretty decent range length dahlsim throw condor dive thawk jump suddenly dive like dahlsims yoga spear move deceptive try jumping back diving condor dive good range done way way useful countering fireball tomahawk buster another version dp go diagonal quick invincible short time beginning rest vulnerable fierce tb extends really far farther ken dp also hit twice close enough pretty nasty fall distance risky delay reach ground minimal combo roundhouse neck kick standing forward fierce tomahawk buster tick standing short mexican typhoon seems work well zangief overall thawk seems versatile character biggest weakness speed made big move spinning leg sweep also nice move executes faster guile fierce trip kick decent range much better ken ryu zangief chun li would say standing forward really nice ryu crouching roundhouse range stick straight fast  deejay  special move machine gun upper punch punch punch  ace rusher  punch charge hop step kick   kick charge dee jay escape roundhouse kick comment machine gun upper hit button get jablike uppercut tapping punch button repeatedly executin move extend punch work well defensive move stop character jumping difficult hit time done four ace rusher look work like guile sonic boom different long recovery time body lean way forward performing hop step kick sort kick turn around kick crouching roundhouse like dahlsim slide used someone jumping unfortunately cant go fireball timing right follow fireball combo jumping hit standing forward fireball jumping hit standing short short spinning kick overall dee jay seems one better character especially useful know use guile far standing fierce good antyair attack jump roundhouse hit far enough hit dahlsim crouching fierce jump biggest flaw lower part body hang really low make hard jump fireball fireball trap seem work well since jumping difficult lack invincible move  fei long  special move triple punch  punch repeat repeat  flaming vertical kick  kick leaping double kick  roundhouse flipover throw  roundhouse throwing distance comment triple punch fireball motion give flaming jab quickly cause slide forward bit follow straight punch third time finish move another punch rush faster balrog rushing punch hard get timing right get multiple hit practice make perfect flaming kick jump air leg fire horizontal range nonexistant height determined kick use bit safer dragon punch soon might defensive crouch late still blocking seems mainly defensive move leaping kick fei long jump double kick pretty decent damage although spends lot time moving forward attack attack come one hell priority combo combo great larger character zangief hawk jumping roundhouse short kick triple punch overall potential next anticharacter like guile kenryu use character without projectile best chance victory  ryu  dragon punch  punch still superior move game deadly damaging red fireball   punch red fireball burn opponent like dhalsims yoga fire fireball  punch longer delay fireball hurricane kick start spinning way way following jump motion hurricane kick  kick air hurricane kick jump hk motion kick still ton damage air hk follows motion normal jump arced sooner hk motion jump higher fly  ken  change dp fierce burn opponent hit time jab hit knock hurricane kick also like ryu flaming fireball see ryu  chun li  fireball   punch charge new fireball use situation opponent definitely either hit like combo block opponent getting delay fireball even longer delay hf fireball actually look like raw egg tossed dissipates dissapears crossing screen faster fireball shorter distance helicopter kick charge kick altered helicopter kick much better opponent jumping animation sequence chun beginning flip knock opponent nt leave standing retaliate work great v kenryu long nt tried v anyone else yet aerial helicopter go quickly
