summary trusted information system ti report intrusion detection system prepared victor h marshall  intrusion detection computer january executive summary computer system security official typically good automated tool gather process auditing information potential computer system intruder challenging determine action constitute potential intrusion complex mainframe computer environment trusted information system ti inc recently completed survey determine auditing tool available research needed develop automated system reliably detect intruder mainframe computer system report done air force includes detail nine specific software tool intrusion detection background computer security official system level always challenging task come daytoday mainframe auditing typically auditing optionsfeatures limited mainframe operating system system software provided hardware vendor also since security auditing logical subset management auditing available auditing optionsfeatures may little value computer security official finally relevant auditing information probably far voluminous process manually availability automated data reductionanalysis tool limited typically audit data security significance trick determining ignore special tool needed partial solution problem could procure develop special automated tool security auditing example ibm mainframe environment program racf caacf catop secret commonly used control data access program ca examine used supplement standard system auditing nevertheless generallyavailable software system comprehensively address problem intrusion detection fact intrusion detection one challenging security auditing function fact existing system designed must tailored specific operating system also generally gather auditing information activity within database management system application software much research development need done intrusion detection generally available report available meantime however would wise stay abreast stateoftheart automated auditing tool helping security manager detect intruder ti inc recently completed comprehensive report tool currently available intrusion detection recommended direction future research ti report entitled  computer system intrusion detection e final technical report  dated september done contract rome air development center griffiss air force base new york ti report comprehensively cover known intrusion detection technique also review nine comprehensive intrusion detection tool currently available development intrusion detection technique although intrusion detection normally accomplished using software tool hardware tool potentially secure easily altered either case intrusion detection requires securityrelated auditing data collected stored analyzed data collection specific event sequence event must defined important enough cause generation audit record potentially every event security significance logging detail every event would probably eliminate hope processing efficiency even effectiveness thus someone must decide event log also noted earlier event logged tend exclusively operating system event would useful able log event internal database management system andor application system data storage auditing data processed realtime go audit log later review security concerned extent storage medium audit log readonly nonvolatile computer system used store audit log connectedlinked one auditing data gathered electronic manual data path protected data analysis far difficult task analyze auditing data comprehensive audit log certainly voluminous reasonable human processing thus following technique addition technique must used ethicallegal combination reduce securityrelevant audit data meaningful conclusion user profile

intrusion detection recognition reduce false positive identification ti report conclusion ti report concludes much good scientific study done intrusion detection technology insufficient time spent analyzing precise user need determining appropriate technology use specific situation cooperatively sharing lesson learned actual intrusion victor h marshall system assurance team leader booz allen
