nikola tesla great scientist specialized field electricity much impressed hear swami explanation samkhya cosmogony theory cycle given hindu particularly struck resemblance samkhya theory matter energy modern physic swami also met new york sir william thompson afterwards lord kelvin professor helmholtz two leading representative western science sarah bernhardt famous french actress interview swami greatly admired teaching party given sarah bernhardt nikola tesla probably first met swami vivekananda sarah bernhardt playing part iziel play name french version life bhudda actress upon seeing swami vivekananda audience arranged meeting also attended nikola tesla letter friend dated february th swami vivekananda noted following  mr tesla charmed hear vedantic prana akasha kalpas according theory modern science entertain  mr tesla think demonstrate mathematically force matter reducible potential energy go see next week get mathematical demonstration swami vivekananda hopeful tesla would able show call matter simply potential energy would reconcile teaching veda modern science swami realized  case vedantic cosmology would placed surest foundation  harmony vedantic theory western science explained following diagram brahman absolute mahat ishvara primal creative energy           prana akasha energy matter tesla understood sanskrit terminology philosophy found good mean describe
