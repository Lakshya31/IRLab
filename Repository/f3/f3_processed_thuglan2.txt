general information lan topology etc official thug production written laughing gas solsbury hill bb please keep name thuglantxt possible released  foreward well previous file lan said next one one would complete list program availible novell lan system description well end school year nt access novell lan summer however lantastic lan set home probably release file soon however since work lan research started write file topology etc since someone else mention local bb figured release file basically introductory guide topology network access method file basically released computer underground however might found interesting lan manager hacker nt really anything breaking security oh well oh way school start month get back novell information basic subject file mentioned lan topology network access method general wiring information threw wiring information nt really anything hacking neither rest file might interesting anyone interested rest file lan topology topology way lan set physically get different type know couple vocabulary term workstation workstation single computer lan us lan server resource server server computer lan allows resource disk drive printer modem etc accessed workstation couple basic type server network server computer usually large hard drive act main  hub  network workstation access majority shared file machine majority resource attached machine print server machine attached one printer job handling print spooling request although print queue often controlled superuser another machine communication server machine machine modem modem responsible handling outside communication file server machine hard drive dedicated network nondedicated server server also workstation ie sit server log network dedicated server server dedicated network log node node computer device lan workstation server node well printer modem etc well thats term know three basic lan topology bus ring star bus lan set bus topology one long cable end connected anything node connected directly cable check lame ascii diagram node  node                                 node  node get idea bus topology reliable method setting network node network go node still communicate ring ring topology sound like node connected circular ring fashion node connected node connected node connected node lame diagram  node  node node  node  got ring topology usually good idea one node go node may able communication node connected node case fairly simple argument sake node went node could communicate node node could communicate node node could communicate node node could communicate  well technically could larger network two node could go one either side node blocking node system designed find shortest path might find one node direction unless designed find alternate route might stuck star star topology main network server node wired directly server something like node node  server  node node star topology better ring topology good bus topology star topology one node could go rest lan would still able function server go none rest lan would function network access method two major network access method know however suspect nt know hey never said knew everything first network access method method used send data around network network access method meant keep data colliding data two major type know token ring passing contention token ring passing token ring passing used primarily guessed token ring network token ring network usually set ring topology although would assume token ring passing could occur matter topology token ring passing use electronic signal called token signal continously sent around network node want send packet data must attach token data ride token around network get node intended contention contention used often csmacd carrier sensing multiple access collision detection set ups like call  waiting  method basically node sends packet data another packet data point whichever one got first keep going one bounce back node originated wait second well literally tinyest microsecond bounce back see way clear general wiring information three main type wiring lan twisted pair coaxial cable fiber optic wiring twisted pair wiring consists two insulated copper wire twisted around basically phone wire common easy way set lan also inexpensive buy phone wire however least efficent method ca nt handle load speed type wire handle coaxial wiring fiber optik line better hold larger capacity data transmit much faster error however type wire much expensive often need wired wall floor make even expensive one way setting lan done home  using serial parralell port even modem connect computer case much lan ibm xt w meg ibm sx w meg hooked together serial port null modem serialparralellmodem connection going much much much slower direct connection data transfered slower use type cable cable connect nic network interface card nic connect wire together also extra power allow computer access network slow down course method much cheaper le null modem cable price lan software lantastic one know work serialparralellmodem connection ezlan software use although applies pay software conclusion oh well underground file  feel free distribute whomever like although apprieciate left entirely intact least left name feel free publish electronic nonelectronic form publication leave intact find error whatever contact board solsbury hill area code warez dudez say greetz   elk insight learning fast phusionman sorry friend nt get served maggies snicker weapon trg gentry good see maggies tuc laughing
