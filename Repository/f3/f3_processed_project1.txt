development relaxation ability relax first prerequisite perhaps even first step deliberately generated physical metal included condition relaxation must relief sense time urgency hurry pending appointment anticipated call service attention must clutter thought impatience sort effectively stifle prospect success many technique available obtaining kind relaxation number good book cover subject simply select method work best three general method seem work two applicable exercise auto selfhypnosis selfstudy book offer method different version matter effective individually efficient speediest way learn selfhypnosis training experienced hypnotist set posthypnotic suggestion bring immediate result however select tutor care responsible practitioner rare neophyte numerous form meditation converted effective relaxation borderland sleep state perhaps easiest natural method usually ensures relaxation body mind simultaneously difficulty lie maintenance delicate  edge  sleep complete wakefulness often simply fall asleep end experiment moment practice conscious awareness taken borderland state destination way achieve know practice technique follows lie preferably tired sleepy become relaxed start drift sleep hold mental attention something anything eye closed hold borderland state indefinitely without falling asleep passed first stage however normal pattern fall asleep many time process consciousness deepening able help let discourage overnight process know successful become bored expect something happen attempt remain borderland state make nervous normal reaction conscious mind seems resent sharing authority wakefulness occurs break relaxation get walk around exercise lie relieve nervousness go sleep try another time mood  fixative  picture thought holding slip away find thinking something else close completion condition achieved condition ability hold calmly borderland state indefinitely mind exclusive thought ready next step condition b

achievement c one fully rested refreshed rather tired sleepy beginning exercise quite important nearly easy achieve write enter relaxation state full energy wakefulness great insurance maintaining conscious control best approach take early attempt condition exercise start immediately wake nap night sleep start exercise move around bed physically body still relaxed sleep mind fully alert nt take many liquid sleeping wo nt immediate need empty bladder upon awakening induction drug none relaxationproducing drug readily available seem help barbiturate
