usenet domain             domain mark r horton bell laboratory columbus ohio abstract past electronic mail used many different kind syntax naming computer login name computer new system called  domain  becoming widely used based heirarchical naming scheme paper intended quick introduction domain detail read document referenced end introduction exactly domain basically way looking world heirarchy tree structure already used using two tree world model work pretty well telephone system post office domain form similar heirarchy electronic mail community post office divide world geographically first country country divide unit subdivide one country usa divide state divide county except certain state like louisiana divide thing like parish county subdivide city town township typically divide street street divide lot address possibly containing room apartment number individual people address address like mark horton room c e broad st columbus ohio usa ignoring name  bell laboratory  zip code redundant information country may subdivide differently example many small country state telephone system similar full phone number might look like  x contains left right country code surprise usa country code   area code central ohio prefix reynoldsburg co individual phone number extension phone number extension phone system usa standardized digit area code digit prefix digit phone number country nt use standard example netherlands number might  country code city code number germany  sweden  britain   note country city code telephone number length punctuation different north american notation within country length telephone number might depend city code even within usa length extension standardized place use last digit telephone number extension use digit extension must ask operator country established local convention number unambigous dialed lefttoright long way indicate done dialing problem key difference philosophy two system evident way address telephone number written address specific information come first least specific last  root tree  right telephone least specific information root left telephone system designed machinery look first digit something pass remainder next level thus effect routing call telephone network course exact sequence dial depends dialing sometimes must dial first get international dialtone must dial calling locally sometimes must leave area code make life interesting people must design box call home office phone world type address called  relative address  since actual address used depends location sender postal system hand allows write address matter sender address get anywhere world even private company mail system yet optional abbreviation possible leave usa im mailing within usa city address usually say  city  place last line type address called  absolute address  since unabbreviated form depend location sender arpanet evolved system absolute address  user host  work machine uucp network evolved system relative address  host user  work machine direct link  host  route mail network find machine fact  user host  syntax become popular many site run mail software accepts syntax look  host  table sends appropriate network  host  nice user interface work well small network set allowed host grows past host run sort administrative problem one problem becomes nearly impossible keep table host name date new machine added somewhere world every day nobody tell try send mail host isnt table replying mail got new host mailing software might try route smarter machine without knowing network send ca nt guess smarter machine forward another problem name space collision nothing prevent host one network choosing name host another network example dec enet  vortex  machine also one uucp name long two network could talk neither ask network permission use name problem compounded consider many computer center name machine    b   c  recognition problem arpa established new way name computer based domain arpanet pioneering domain convention many computer network falling line since first naming convention look like really stand chance working milnet portion arpanet domain csnet one appears digital uucp using domain well domain look lot like postal address simple syntax fit one line easy type easy computer handle illustrate old routed uucp address might read  sdcsvax ucbvax allegra cbosgd mark  domain version might read  mark dosgcbattuucp  machine named dosgcbattuucp uucp domain company columbus site operating system group project fourth machine course example somewhat verbose contrived illustrates heirarchy well people would rather type something like  cbosgdattuucp  even  cbosgduucp  actual domain usually set nt type much may wonder single sign present address read  markdosgcbattuucp  fact originally proposed form example rfc contain sign sign present arpanet site felt strong need divider domain name one computer left hand side subject whatever interpretation domain chooses example att domain chooses address people full name rather login address like  markhorton attuucp  make clear machine att domain interpret string  markhorton  address  markhortonattuucp  routing software might try find machine named  horton   markhorton  way case ignored domain  attuucp   attuucp  left sign however domain interpret text way want case ignored significant important note domain route people look number first example number second assume latter routed machine called  uucp  another called  att  another called  cb  possible set mail routing software indeed worst case even without reasonable set table method always work intent  dosgcbattuucp  name machine path get particular domain absolute address route depend location sender subroutine charged figuring given domain based machine name high quality environment like arpa internet query table name server come bit host number connect directly machine uucp environment nt concept two process arbitrary machine talking directly forward mail one hop time get appropriate destination case subroutine decides name represents local machine decides neighbor forward message domain background still nt said domain answer hope worth wait domain subtree world tree example  uucp  top level domain subtree  root  represents name machine beneath tree  attuucp  subdomain  uucp  representing name machine subdomains beneath  att  tree similarly  cbattuucp   osgcbattuucp  even  dosgcbattuucp  although  dosgcbattuucp   leaf  domain representing one machine domain certain property key property  registry  domain list name immediate subdomains plus information get one also contact person domain person responsible domain keeping registry uptodate serving point contact outside query setting policy requirement subdomains subdomain decide allow subdomains establish requirement subdomains must meet included registry example  cb  domain might require subdomains physically located building columbus arpa established certain requirement top level domain requirement specify must list subdomains contact person responsible person authority domain site something bad made stop minimum size prevent small domain top level pair nameservers redundancy provide directoryassistance facility domain lax requirement place subdomains making harder top level domain somewhere lower tree course subdomain parent responsible one requirement present unique parent machine entire subdomain need appear one place tree thus  cb  might appear  att  domain  ohio  domain allows domain structured flexibly simple geography used postal service telephone company organization topography used parallel actually instance done postal service overseas military mail telephone system prefix appear one area code eg near washington dc silicon valley also allows domain split join remaining upward compatible old address domain represent specific machine necessarily pretty obvious full path like  dcbosgattuucp  refers exactly one machine osg domain might decide  cbosgattuucp  represents particular gateway machine might decide represents set machine several might gateway  attuucp  domain might decide several machine  ihnpuucp   whgwjuucp   hogtwuucp  entry point  attuucp  might decide represents spot name space machine example machine corresponding  arpa   uucp  root domain decides naming space algorithm getting mail one machine another closely linked routing mail system figure without help structure name domain syntax allow explicit route case want exercise particular route gateway balking syntax  dom dom  domn user domain  example ihnpuucp ucbvaxuucp joe nicarpa forcing routed dom dom  domn domn sent final address behaves exactly like uucp routing syntax although somewhat verbose way doubt noticed form electronic address read lefttoright cbosgd mark others read righttoleft mark berkeley better real answer religious issue nt make much difference lefttoright probably bit easier computer deal understand something left ignore remainder address almost easy program read righttoleft ease going lefttoright probably back mind designer invented host user host user hand claim user host easier human read since people tend start reading left quit soon recognize login name person also mail program print table header may truncate sender address make fit fixed number column probably useful read  mark dosga   ucbvax sdcsv  pretty minor issue human adapt skip end address program truncate left real problem world contains lefttoright righttoleft syntax ambiguous address like x z consider single problem turn killer best single reason try stamp one favor anyway current world full lot interesting kind mail syntax old arpa  user host  still used arpanet many system explicit routing sometimes done address like  user host host  sends mail host let host interpret  user host  address one made illegal year ago many arpanet host depended syntax still used uucp us  h h h user  requiring user route mail berknets use  host user  allow explicit routing get mail one host another routed gateway thus address  csvax mark berkeley  arpanet would send mail berkeley would forward berknet address csvax mark send mail arpanet uucp address  ihnp ucbvax sam foounix  would route ihnp ucbvax would interpret  sam foounix  arpanet address pas along berknetuucp gateway berknetarpanet gateway different machine address  csvax ihnp ihnss warren berkeley  common see combination lefttoright uucp syntax righttoleft arpanet syntax make thing pretty complex berknets gone lot gateway uucp arpanet arpanetlike mail network sending mail address know path arpanet onto uucp even harder suppose address ihnp ihnss warren berkeley host rlgvax us seismo arpanet gateway must send seismo ihnp ihnss warren berkeley pretty hard read recipient try reply idea break address two uucp piece occurs arpanet site routing across uucp world somebody ethernet using domain locally send address something like  xxx berkeleyarpa  get uucp  ihnp decvax island yyy  get ethernet  sam csvaxisland  get across ethernet single address would therefore ihnp decvax island sam csvaxisland berkeleyarpa much ask person mailer understand even worse gateway deal ambiguous name like ihnp mark berkeley parsed either  ihnp mark berkeley  accordance arpanet convention  ihnp mark berkeley  old uucp would another important reason using domain mailing address becomes absolute instead relative becomes possible put electronic address business card signature file without worrying writing six different form fifteen host know
