tempest method computer data interception         al muick p system oct      let begin brief history spent better part six year uncle sam country club better known u army working intelligence security command better known asa  army security agency time primary duty cryptology cryptologic intercept counterintelligence field first sergeant whatta drag tell come heading cryptologic intercept incidently know stationed field station augsburg west germany know read book puzzle palace interception radiated data computer computer terminal known world asa  tempest  tempest intercept may accomplished several way one via mobile van commo equipment board two via strategicly stationed intercept site field station augsburg third rarely used relay one site another run tempest operation need good communication receiver high frequency high frequency adjustable bandwidth vfo plan intercept leave exploitation collected intelligence later need highquality tape deck one cheapassed portable high quality deck plan exploitation later still need convert communication receiver recordable frequency simply patch output mhz input plug tape deck something mhz sol unless downconverter around ability construct one effect recording rf frequency tape deck vice audio frequency tape deck must run either  ip order record signal later play signal back exploitation soon intercept station best use van set receiver antenna recorder ready engage intercept target computer rf shielded day receiver better damn sensitive selective bandwidth planning intercept computer need outside building location possible since know microprocessor operate frequency  mhz look radiated data frequency range spectrum analyzer connected output aid discerning signal binary emission target computer know use spectrum analyzer prove invaluable since complicated attempt explain proper use simply scan band  mhz find radiated signal must go nd rd th etc harmonic local interference primary frequency high tune spot come best next adjust bandwidth hear signal pure day little outside interference target tuned may want drive around block away avoid detection remember go far lose signal mainframe computer unprotected sometimes radiate signal four mile typical pc computer radiate signal least  mile unprotected picked intercept site parked van made sure still signal coming good strength next step easy simply connect output low frequency input deck let er rip find  reel suit purpose fine able get least one two uids pws amount time  ip tape done may want record side pack gear head home home need another piece equipment possibly two various surplus magazine see machine called  visicorder  advertised machine burn copy binary code onto lightsensitive paper cost money basically invaluable ready signal exploitation need play recorded tape input communication receiver output connected input visicorder give truest binary representation paper desire may connect audio communication receiver audio input visicorder audio rectified dc get crisp clear presentation paper remember  dc lie representation may clear binary spacing slightly increasing error continue finally wind continuous error assuming made proper connection get beer relaxation funny lil pill whatever make relax  come hairpulling part begin playback deck receiver initiate visicorder print mode recommend mediumfast speed use slow speed conserve paper cheap fucker baud close together render paper useless wou wind wasting paper anyway point print minute worth paper paper printed expose light develops several x  card handy soon develops scan paper binary stream section three four smallest closest together bit ascii found section place one x  card base section mark tick mark bit stop end smallest bit ready asa call  bustin baud  know one ascii byte consists bit simply start reasonable point beginning interception begin mark tick mark along binary stream even come across wide mark many thin tick x  card necessary break ascii code complete bit ascii code end tutorial convenience marked paper count first eight bit eg refer ascii chart find character fit ca nt find one immediately nt despair try using complement bit code front ie reverse decoded instead try  still found anything slide card one bit try get another byte ascii time may come complement check table remeber may eight time shift bit eight time make sense long tedious pay end note illegal punishable federal law assume responsibility action neither operator p presented information question please leave mail   happy hacking  al muick asa life forever bit ascii code bit ascii simply delete last bit  always  something keep mind  al binary meaning null start message end address end message end transmission wru ru  bell audible signal format
