mr anonymous subject killer shroom file hell well know growing psychedelic mushroom  information taken book rare book collection university texas austin entitled  magic mushroom cultivation  published written stephen h pollock anyway used ricecake method described currently growing third batch produced pretty potent mushroom feel need mention giving information informational purpose dont expect anyone else actually undertake technique describe may violate certain law  would nt give information thought might something illegal describe technique use like say many method growing shrooms difficult others simply presenting method worked well never dud batch  always fruited readily never poisoned others contaminated shrooms mention however procedure describe one give maximum yield mushroom  advantage growing medium ingested psychedelic effect see section storage method ingestion another point like make strongly recommend getting information mushroom cultivation starting batch perhaps best book seen subject  mushroom cultivator  paul stamets give extremely detailed information cultivation psychedelic mushroom highly recommend read book following cultivation procedure  grow psychedelic mushroom  material needed sporeprint strain psychedelic mushroom make sure real thing contaminated anything dust example pressure cooker size preferably one qt liquid capacity expensive item necessity borrow rent buy steal one one dozen new canning jar quart size pref wide mouthed lid boxbag brown rice  white rice long grainwild rice might also good growing medium  maybe even better regular brown rice although positive used halfandhalf mix brown rice long grain wild rice worked fine however possible disadvantage using long grainwild rice contaminant darkcolored mold difficult spot growing medium something scrape spore print jar  want something like stiff metal wire handle heat end red hot flame sterilize without burning finger find probe biology dissection kit work wonderfully flame source alcohol lamp hard make small jar filled rubbing alcohol cotton ball wick suppose could use lighter prefer making alcohol lamp  make sure nt burn place clean place store jar  relatively constant temp optimum temperature starting shrooms degree f found room temperature work fairly well closet shelf fine experience want place pretty dustbug free nt want storage area airtight shrooms breathe like living organism many book recommend making kind superclean box store jar never bothered source information growing shrooms one stress everything sterile possible however cut corner still successful use head lead  optional material germkilling soap washing hand alcohol sterilizing hand etc surgical glove dust mask hairnet airfiltering machine pollenex couple gallon jug distilled water spray bottle bleach see stuff help make thing bit sterile  definetly recommended procedure finally procedure follow ricecake method propagating psychedelic mushroom use method number reason one first ever batch consisted jar manure medium brown rice medium found rice cake produced shrooms longer period time manurefilled jar rice obvious advantage easy obtain  trekking thru pasture looking fresh cowshit also manure stink like hell cooked pressure cooker perhaps biggest advantage rice cake method rice cake longer produce crop shrooms mo actually consume rice cake given course detect contaminant rice cake mold bacteria mushroom growth stop rice cake provide trip  people see end article method ingesting mushroomsrice cake  procedure promise turn airconditioner place going  important work draftfree area turning ac allow dust room settle including heavier mold spore contaminate ricecake medium set pressure cooker make sure read manual one nt want damn pressure cooker exploding anything like  wash pressure cooker good measure also wash jar lid would nt use towel dry though wipe germ dust back em wash recommended wear long sleeved shirt pull hair back wear cap hairnet nt think dust mask would necessary point maybe later though  quartsize canning jar add  cup brown rice   cup water use distilled water buy grocery store  nt trust tap water fill jar mixture many fit pressure cooker without stacking jamming place lid jar rubber leave lid loose place jar bottom rack pressure cooker recommend using rack way jar wo nt tip spill water boil around using rack also keep breaking heat burner directly quart pressure cooker add quart water much jar start float tip use distilled water follow direction sealing pressure cooker recommend rub dab cooking oil seal seal properly easier close open right book turn stove highest setting allow pressure inside cooker build lb pressure inside cooker reached lb want maintain level one complete hour may turn stove brief period pressure nt rise unsafe level lb hour passed turn stove let pressure cooker cool opening also nt try rush cooling process jar may crack opening pr cooker wash maybe use rubbing alcohol put surgical glove time dust mask although usu use shirt keep breathing germ jar long sleeve hat whatever recommended literally million germ falling body given moment sterility absence draft utmost importance  book recommend filling spray bottle bleach water solution using mist air room reduce airborne contaminant open pressure cooker let jar cool pretty close room temp remove jar soon crack start new jar pay little patient may want tighten lid bit airgerms ca nt contaminate rice cake jar cool ready go  heat wire loopprobewhatever glowing red put dust mask pull shirt nose mouth lift lid jar set sterile surface inside face let friend hold lid make sure person washedsterilized hisher hand well get sporeprint hold open jar acute angle use sterilized wire loopprobe gently scrape tap sporeprint get spore onto rice cake see dark speck fall onto rice done sufficiently  anything see probably several thousand spore sporeprint size nickel easily innoculate dozen jar screw jar lid tightly shake jar rice cake break allow spore spread throughout rice medium thus increasing chance success good way start process inspect jar carefully crack invert jar strike lid heel hand next unscrew lid almost come  allows air get jar usually screw lid  turn  enough wo nt fall easily done jar put jar safe clean place fairly constant temp dark place best day week see white fluffy mycelium appear  look like white fuzz color fuzz green black etc mold jar disposed kidding certain contaminant mold particular cause illness even death ingest contaminated shrooms better safe sorry believe also lookout bacterial infection rice medium often appear colored orange pink runny clammy looking gunk rice thrown immediately well bacterial infection may also give kind putrid odor course taking lid jar stage rice get soft result pressure cooking initial shaking jar may smear gellooking gunk inside jar comparing rest jar able tell difference gunk bacterial infection like said use head actually another step done sit back wait nature take course shrooms pretty much maintenancefree fruiting start occur take anywhere week month mycelium completely permeate rice medium start getting stringy looking fan shaped runner white fuzzy growth mushroom formation far jar getting couple hour light per day  fluorescent ok natural sunlight superb make sure jar nt get warm course stage lookout possible contaminant mycelium way mycelium mature may start staining blue spot due bruising think  nt mistake mold infection keep close eye change color white coloring shrooms first appear tiny white pinhead cap darken p cubensis lovely reddish brown shrooms growing lid jar loose allow air exchange also mushroom grow best environment humidity think shrooms may need moist environment one thing simply use spray bottle spray boiled distilled water directly onto lid jar find moisture condenses inside jar run inside jar moisturizing mycelium could also lightly mist surface rice cake look dry nt want thing wet however promote moldbacteria growth actually inhibit mushroom formation another possible method replace lid double layer paper towel misted daily  although would think actual lid jar would invite contamination personal opinion important air exchange take place storage area  becomes important fruiting occurs mycelium give co need remember co heavier normal air might good tip jar time day let co dissipate jar harvesting shrooms  ripe  soon white membrane connecting cap stem broken somewhat although nt want pick reached full size harvest individual mushroom wash hand well  usu use rubbing alcohol take lid jar grasp mushroom firmly near base may need use pair sterilized tweezer usu  avoid placing germy hand inside jar brisk twisting motion help free shroom mycelium difficult harvest using method clean hand wash small knife preferably antibacterial soap dip blade alcohol flame several second use tip sterilized knife cut mushroom close rice cake possible storage method ingestion avoid crushing fresh mushroom storing blue staining common psychedelic mushroom evidence oxidation  meaning active ingredient psilocin psilocybin oxidized  rendering shrooms inactive refrigeration recommended freezing fresh mushroom avoided since expansion freezing water cell rupture cell wall thus open oxidation mushroom frozen fresh may attractive blue color inactive  storage fresh mushroom breathable container paper bag stored refrigerator avoid putting fresh shrooms ziploc bag may become slimy moldy  ugh heard people also storing fresh shrooms chopping mixing honey  shroom honey spread bread whatever eaten method drying mushroom although found dried shrooms much weaker fresh one one way dry placing cookie sheet oven lowest temp door slightly open simply drying sunlight said work also main problem dried shrooms experience near potent fresh shrooms believe reason two psychoactive ingredient psilocin psilocybin present equal amount fresh shrooms psilocin unstable compound compared psilocybin break readily exposed heat oxygen normal dosage dried shrooms gram dried never  trip  dried shrooms  fresh stuff ate gram dried shrooms got buzz  like stoned drunk like shrooms fresh course luxury since grow whether dried fresh many interesting way ingest current favorite method blend  fresh one blender orange juice  effect fantastic taste tolerable believe due part fact shrooms almost completely liquified blending process releasing  good stuff  orange juice making readily absorbed stomach people may say vitamin c oj also enhances effect may myth another good method one used eat rice cake chop rice cake shrooms brown second butter margarine pouring omelete mixture mushroom omeletes meal good trip tasty way ingest shrooms happen dislike taste shrooms yet another method taking shrooms make milkshake blender add shrooms make kind  strawberry smoothie  way remember though dairy product may delayblock absorption certain substance another method ingestion boil shrooms fresh dried rice cake couple cup water minute sunk one source say either add tea bag hot tea make koolaid cooled water straining shrooms course sprinkling fresh dried shrooms chopped onto pizza spaghetti sauce another treat  fun  shroom party  since psilocin psilocybin soluble water alcohol soaking shrooms liquor release active ingredient liquor making powerfully intoxicating liquor la way  emerald dragon  made marijuana  tried smoking couple dried shroom cap got slightest buzz harsh smoke real effect tell truth mention shroom production really tapered able tell month rice cake eatenused closely examine decide green black mold contaminant present note rice cake probably kind funky color  mix white steel blue gray maybe even purple place spore falling ingested several scarylooking rice cake however ill effect use head doubt toss  worth trip pun intended hospital single rice cake enough people trip although probably better figure best trip half rice cake chopped cooked omelete love ricecake method  shrooms stop growing waste speaking waste ever rice cake nt want risk eating might use innoculate compost pile pasture full cow shit inserting small piece cowpie compost pile think idea starting culture wild mushroom area  making sporeprints really easy wash hand well take fresh shroom gently twist cap away stem usually use sterilized knife blade cut stem close cap without touching much place cap gill sterile card piece glass cover cap card clean small container keep draft blowing spore away prevent dustcontaminants settling cardglass usu use small juice glass purpose leave covered shroom cap cardglass overnight voila suggest folding card next day keeping airtight container small ziploc bag refrigerator told spore print keep year airtight refrigerated frozen environment personal experience know still viable month oh way try find use shroom cap collected spore  still psychoactive sure think something   appendix additional tip optimal yield additional tip based learned  mushroom cultivator   one thing come mind degree f best temp starting growth process something remember though temp inside jar several degree higher surrounding air temp growth mycelium generates small amount heat  mushroom cultivator  tell decreasing temperature various stage growth promote fruiting term use mushroom growth reading  tmc  would also advise building simple growth chamber serve number purpose create sterile environment guarding contamination help keep temp high constant help keep humidity high constant provide place hide jar rather shelf closet wherever recommend get styrofoam ice chest one large enough hold jar got used one got circle k le buck may want line inside aluminum foil increase reflection light within chamber good ready expose culture light point need cut large hole lid  cut much lid make sure leave enough margin still function lid use kind tape tape saran wrap hole lid allows light growbox help keep dust mold contaminant nt mess around lid right away though  tmc  suggests leaving jar total darkness first week two  even point suggest using red light examine jar growth andor contaminant book also suggests air exchange initial growth phase guess could leave lid loose like suggested leave lid box oh way  botany chemistry hallucinogen  schultes hoffman say medium adult oral dose  mg psilocybin dried shrooms contain percent psilocybin  sample psilocybe mexicana think p cubensis may potent also mention something else interesting  say psilocybin psilocin present equal amount fresh shrooms psilocin something like  time psychoactive psilocybin given fact psilocin sensitive oxidation break upon drying suppose seems like probable reason fresh one much potent dried one recently discovered method drying shrooms without heat may help retain potency level similar fresh one although nt tried shrooms dried method nt know sure true cover bottom shallow baking dish layer uncooked dry rice  usually rice left bag initial startup procedure place clean paper towel layer rice place freshly harvested mushroom top paper towel cover dish another clean paper towel place dish refrigerator find rice absorbs moisture shrooms completely dried within week careful pile fresh mushroom top one another dish  spread directly paper towel may dry creates possibility getting moldy ruin course refrigerator
