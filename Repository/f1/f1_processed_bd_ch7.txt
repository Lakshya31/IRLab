generally pm local time transferring file across network take considerable computing power day likely needed whatever computer main function ftp site accessible public hour day though find noted list ftp site  friend archie find file want though year ago could quite pain  master directory tell given file might stored net want slog hundred file library looking something alan emtage bill heelan peter deutsch student mcgill university montreal asked question unlike weather though something created database system called archie would periodically call file library basically find available turn anybody could dial archie type file name see net available archie currently catalog close  file library around world today three way ask archie find file telnet  client  archie program host system e

host system command line worked type anonymous hit enter see lot reference net  anonymous ftp  get name  nt really tell library site name reason site set anybody gain access certain public file letting people account site log access personal file next asked password password use email address come guest connection accepted restriction apply remote system type unix using binary mode transfer file ftp type l hit enter see something awful like port command successful opening ascii mode data connection binls total rwrwr  mar  readmeposting drxrxrx nov  bin rwr  r  apr  core dr  r  r  nov

actually use dir well used msdos could lead confusion try use dir host system wo nt work probably better remember always use l directory online first letter line tell whether listing directory file first letter    l  directory otherwise file rest weird set letter dash consist  flag  tell ftp site look change delete file safely ignore also ignore rest line get second number one date tell large file byte line directory number give rough indication many item directory  directory listing byte relatively small next come date file directory uploaded followed finally name notice readmeposting file top directory archive site  read  document usually contains basic information site resource use let get file information see transfer file ftp prompt type get readme hit enter note ftp site different unix site general casesensitive see something like port command successful opening binary mode data connection readme byte transfer complete byte received second  kbytess file located home directory host system download computer simple  get  command key transferring file archive site host system first letter line start   directory enter look file start  r  file get next item interest fifth column tell large item byte followed date time loaded archive followed finally name many site provide  readme  file list simple instruction available file site use file named  index   index  something similar want download one file time say series document use mget instead get example mget txt transfer copy every file ending txt given directory file copied asked sure want despite mget could still save considerable time  wo nt type every single file name want save even time sure really want given file type prompt mget command turn prompt file zapped right home directory one command keep mind want get copy computer program type bin hit enter tell ftp site host site sending binary file ie program ftp site use binary format default good idea case connected one nt switch directory type cd directoryname substituting name directory want access hit enter type l hit enter get file listing particular directory move back directory tree type cd  note space first period hit enter could type cdup hit enter keep get directory interest alternately already know directory path file want friend archie connect could simply type get directorysubdirectoryfilename many site file meant public consumption pub public directory sometimes see info directory almost every site bin directory first glance sound like bin interesting stuff might dumped actually stand  binary  simply place system administrator store program run ftp system lostfound another directory look interesting actually never anything public interest saw use archie example see system administrator go little berserk naming file fortunately way rename file transferred using archie example type get ztermsyscoloriconshqx ztermhqx hit enter instead deal constantly file called ztermsyscoloriconshqx one called simply ztermhqx last three letter bring something else many program file compressed save space transmission time order actually use use uncompress program first  odd letter  decoding file ending wide variety compression method use tell method used last one three letter end file common one need un compress file create decompression program located archie txt txt mean file document rather program p p postscript document adobe page description language print file postscript capable printer use previewer like gnu project ghostscript doc doc another common  extension  document decompression needed unless followed z indicates unix compression method uncompress type uncompress filenamez hit enter host system command line file compressed text file read online instead typing zcat filenametxtz uzip msdos program let download file uncompress computer macintosh equivalent program called maccompress use archie find zip zip indicate file compressed common msdos compression program known pkzip use archie find pkzipexe many unix system let unzip file program called well unzip gz unix version zip uncompress type gunzip filenamegz host system command line zoo zoo unix msdos compression format use program called zoo hqx hqx mactintosh compression format requires binhex program shar another unix format use unshar uncompress shar tar another unix format often used compress several related file one large file unix system program called tar  untarring  file often  tarred  file also compressed gz method first use uncompress tar sit sit mactinosh format requires stuffit program arc another msdos format requires use arc arce program lhz another msdos format requires use lharc last word caution check size file get net move data phenomenal rate speed  byte file get transferred host system second could take hour two download computer using baud modem host system may also limit amount byte store online one time also although really extremely unlikely ever get file infected virus plan

download see file might interested another file frequently see called lslrz contains listing every file system without description name come unix command l lr give listing file directory z end mean file compressed mean use unix uncompress command read file finally system administrator almost seem delight making thing difficult  one take full advantage unix ability create absurdly long file name ftp site see file name long character full capital letter underscore every orthographic device make almost impossible type file name correctly try get secret weapon mget command type mget space first
