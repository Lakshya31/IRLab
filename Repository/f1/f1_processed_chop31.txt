file split would normally occur chop something special return character example file  byte split part computed break point byte     force break occur exactly point using x exact switch command line let chop try find logical breaking point file normally carriage return line feed term  return string   return character  mean sequence one character defines newline interesting boundary file chop assumes would prefer split file natural boundary rather someplace middle default chop assumes break occur carriage return line feed character sequence cr lf  hex thus chop plan break file th byte actually look little ahead byte try find newline cr lf split rather byte redefine return string something else example compuserve message begin   character sequence defining sequence return string instruct chop split file message  message would split across chop output file would define   return string using switch  n  command line see example chop ordinarily split file return string make split happen return string using h switch would probably want use switch preceding compuserve example since   character mark beginning message would probably want first character new file rather last character preceding file also limit far chop willing search return string l parameter determines many byte forward computed break point chop look return default byte find return string within number
