hopefully spawn new idea experiment exciting confusing area psychedelic research summary purpose paper summarize current work three betacarboline harmala alkaloidcontaining plant ie passiflora incarnata passion flower peganum harmala syrian rue bansteriopsis caapi principal ingredient yage specifically wish report phenomenon comparative activity extract plant smoked conjunction dmt source plant material passion flower purchased dried whole chopped plant material herb store seed syrian rue purchased specialty seed service attempt made ascertain origin plant material banisteriopsis caapi obtained private plantation hawaii caapi arrived cut length one foot long ranged diameter one quarter inch one half inch original plant specimen collected amazon grower extraction technique used extraction technique three plant developed technique smoking passion flower potentiate psilocybian mushroom see wished data set experiment comparable technique twostage extraction first extraction used boiling alcohol used vodka water infusion followed second extraction using boiled distilled water infusion boiled several hour  slow cooker  ideal case caapi bark peeled strip first syrian rue first ground seed fine passion flower caapi second extract essentially clear seemed unnecessary however case syrian rue second extract bright cloudy yellow may indicate harmine solution plant material strained compressed extraction liquid two extraction combined dried using low heat slow cooker result brown caramally mass passion flower caapi weight original passion flower rue caapi except case passion flower see clear advantage extraction smoking original plant material due relatively minor concentration amount needed smoke plain water infusion would also seem effective removing harmine would result le plant component extracted syrian rue extract interesting actually long thin yellowish crystal brownish red hard clear matrix gooey like two extract surprising given assumed concentration betacarboline alkaloid based rough averaging variety source upfront betacarboline concentration estimate plant material follows plant betacarbolines ratio syrian rue              rue   caapi  passion flower   usage case smoked extract reached subjectively high previous work passion flower extract smoking significant amount seem get one higher intensified physical symptom one felt increasingly sick far passion flower experimented oral dose oral infusion plant planned fall series experiment plant material smoked match lighter torch way promote boiling material rather burning seems yield effective high highly concentrated rue extract lends nicely smoking  hash oil  pipe flame heating bowl outside high high particularly psychedelic hallucinogenic one feel calm calming effect particularly noted observer significant change facial expression tone voice limb become heavy lethargic visibly tremble hypersalivation occurs particularly back mouth making particularly smooth smoke slight irritation urethra anus sometimes noted higher dosage dizziness nausea set little increase high closed eye imagery best hypnagogic say faint moving outline discerned closed eye one particularly vivid imagination ghostly outline figure discerned literal minded see dim shifting blob light dark one experienced dmt high dose mushroom would ever call vision high come stabilizes minute smoking mentioned difficult get higher smoking one stop point noticeable thing would calm unapprehensive state take particular note diminishing apprehension since always apprehensive smoke dmt diminution absence noticeable passion flower mentally foggiest high curiously strongest  antidepressant  effect may related overall mix alkaloid passion flower see syrian rue clearest cleanest high caapi subjectively caapi least  antidepressant  effect dosage dosage ratio original plant material smoked subjectively reaching level high roughly estimated follows plant dosage ratio          rue caapi passion flower dosage ratio based mass original plant material say get high smoking one ounce syrian rue would require smoking ounce caapi two kilogram passion flower curiously although various field researcher estimate betacarboline dosage native brew range mg dosage needed dosage mg range noted increasing dosage increase high aggravated physical symptom even tryptamines taken later addition increasing dosage past point significantly alter combined trip  switch  brain sufficient betacarbolines set     action would take place rule possibility second  switch  mg range might missed tryptamine combination comparison purpose plant material smoked according method approximately minute plantmaterialhigh stabilized mg dmt smoked one u would go entire procedure kept note timing following consistent effect observed overall impact trip heightened far normally threshold effect mg dose dmt subjectively dose felt like  mg roughly tripled intensity overall length dmt  flash  subsequent pattern lengthened  flash  vision normally minute mg dosage minute betacarboline predosing  mg dmt total period intense closed eye imagery normally le minute including flash extended uniformly minute additional minute slowly decreasing tail closed eye pattern auditory effect pronounced almost overwhelming several occasion fact auditory effect stronger even extremely high dose trip smoked mg dmt initial sound socalled  carrier wave  opening buzz described  tearing plastic  greatly amplified dmt  music  describe xylophonetype sound accompanies vision extremely loud seemed keep coming point became disturbing several trip basic  jeweled dome   chrysanthemum  pattern seen  vision flash  fractured separated instead uniform circular pattern seemed distinctive left right half pattern new hard describe pattern middle overall effect pattern seemed u mushroomlike although would hard pressed give detailed explanation felt way similarly vision seemed unfold leisurely fashion reminded mushroom dmt effect still hit fast hard rushed  million thing  feeling dmt smoked alone quite muted color pattern also shifted compared dmt alone since ca nt accurately describe color first place hard pin could characterized le primary jewellike fewer le saturated color dmt alone finally one come vision state  woozey  feeling quite pronounced additional minute feeling reminiscent mushroom  knockdown  content vision also altered fewer  alien selftransforming elfmachines  vision recognizable thing strange animal hooded figure marched ba relief procession griffinlike monster rhythmically changed beautiful naked woman back feelingtone serious unlike playfulness cheerful even though quite terrifying hilarity  selftransforming elf machine  experienced dmt alone intensity altered hesitate say increase since dmt intense change feeling tone serious almost personally directed information trance subjectively made trip intense one trip one u made contact highly serious palpable entity whose message could quite simply summarized  sure want get far extreme done path destruction gnosis  subjectively preferred syrian rue potentiate dmt gave cleanest intense high never taken true ayahuasca detailed discussion trip content someone significant experience brew confirmed trip content like short ayahuasca trip passion flower least desirable potentiator probably due low harmine content proportion total betacarboline content amount required effective tryptamine potentiation left u foggy somewhat sick furthermore mao effect lingered two three day caapi effect anomalous observation brings u curious set observation first although literature would indicate harmine mao inhibition reversed five hour effect smoked plant material continued least hour say clear potentiation noticed amount time elapsed hypothesize effect due primarily betacarbolines harmine present plant material qualitatively weaker mao inhibitor may duration effect much longer however reason believe something additional due tryptamines may happening taken  gram potent dried stropharia interested making contact  voice head  phenomenon potentiated mushroom smoking gram passion flower reduced described starting minute eating mushroom potentiation quite overwhelming smoking one quarter plant material fresh lungfull brought within second powerful  starburst   intersecting lightning bolt  hallucination eye opened obscured welllit room  voice  phenomenon loud clear unsettling content trip described high frontier issue trip attempted several occasion invoke voice phenomenon mushroom dosage gram avail even curiously effect clear instance mao inhibition voice head vision closed opened eye finally end period clear potentiation another psychedelic lsd occurred discrete short interval period day realize sound unbelievable however happen opinion peculiar longterm effect initiated large combined dos tryptamines betacarbolines adequately explained using current model brain chemistry additionally since rather harrowing trip mushroom  voice  inescapable even dosage low approximately one gram le spectacular longterm effect also noticed  lockingin  tuningin effect betacarbolinedmt combination effect previously elusive dmt alone became easy invoke occurred combination note understand conversation investigator approach first taking mushroom smoking betacarboline material mushroom effect begin come efficacious approach another curious observation  minute barrier  far successful causing dmt imagery last longer minute irrespective dosage type underlying predose plant material make matter interesting experiment dmt mda also mild mao inhibitor dmt effect gain lengthened minute see  note underground  yet ayahuasca produce trip last several hour present explanation especially since much active component orally consumed brew inactivated stomach intestine absorbed experiment predosed dmt taken another psychedelic several hour later noted discernible mda dramatic effect mushroom lsd second substance taken much hour dmt see  note underground no  hard explain since total dmt experience last one hour however smoked dmt flash smoked betacarboline plant material unable cause clear dmt imagery happen immediate feeling depression almost exactly opposite effect mood dmt one final hardtoexplain phenomenon one quarter trip coming trance condition stabilized least felt minute smoking dmt experienced rush  information  mind psychedelic effect say without visual physical auditory shift suddenly possessed mind complex detailed lengthy thought non ida come conviction existed head even fragment instant content thought bizarre direction accomplish activity normally regarded supernatural impossible andor crazy furthermore content thought encouraging u attempt feat first hand experience schizophrenic berkeley street people reading literature caused u conclude type phenomenon would considered clear instance schizophrenic thinking betacarboline potentiation lsd also experimented potentiation lsd betacarboline containing plant generically effect follow pattern subjectively dose feel three four time potent actually closed eye imagery greatly enhanced circular highly detailed bright imagery visible sic microgram higher dos microgram feeling ancestral presence never felt outside presence lsd alone several hundred acid trip found quite common lsd combined another psychedelic closedeye pattern  almost vision  say clearer hypnagogic imagery overwhelming clear dmt vision visuals like clear dream imagery mood elevation quite astounding one point one u shouted  could nt possibly bad trip stuff  mood swing buoyant elation slowly receded baseline course trip tentative conclusion suggestion research restate obvious indole psychedelics taken state mao inhibition much intense qualitatively different taken alone believe combination offer numerous fruitful avenue research additionally find syrian rue seed convenient concentrated easily obtainable source betacarbolines serve substitute exotic difficult obtain banisteriopsis caapi clearly next area research area  synthetic ayahuasca  trying perfect orally administered mixture syrian rue synthetic dmt qualitatively behaves like south american plant brew additional work done smoked mixture investigate  minute barrier  provide qualitative mixture future betacarbolinetryptamine cookbook finally hope information article might correlated work researcher suggest entirely new area research provide explanation phenomenon
