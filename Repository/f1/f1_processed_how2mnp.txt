 preface  reading probably modem modem may equipped mnp error correctioncompression protocol probably mnp explained soon mnp help work faster addition errorfree connection feature increase effective modem speed beyond rated value mnp chance using correctly probably communicate fast word probably paying bezeq using mnp correctly requires set various option various location modem communication program file transfer protocol must set option correctly make mnp work moreover communicating partner bb must also set option correctly default come modem software help usually wrong article intended help determine setting utilize modem best basic idea simple first must get modem work highest speed word setup mnp correctly must make sure computer software become bottleneck slow modem simple idea easy implement however read carefully one last remark many brand mnp modem market even communication program file transfer protocol cover modem discussion based mainly everex ev know best software part discus telix telemate puma bimodem dsz mention modem software package favorite one may among read anyhow understand basic idea probably able implement hardware software item  modem basic  understand let draw basic fact necessarily exact good enough discussion familiar fact skip following section let assume computer want send data computer happens computer sends data  serial adapter   r

internal  modem everex ev combine serial adapter modem single card receive parallel data send voice vice versa transparent software since singlecard modem emulates serial adapter connected external modem difference either computer telephone line side  modem detail  let get closer examine point higher detail serial adapter  full duplex  probably modem mean receive transmit data time serial

instead relying extra hardware line method us special ascii value sent standard data unique meaning value usually xon hex mean  start  xoff hex mean  stop  using xonxoff several disadvantage slows transmission handshaking come sequence rather parallel data important xonxoff character used handshaking  swallowed  transmitted part normal data one thing know modem usually work two mode normal mode everything send modem transmitted phone partner modem may also operate  command  mode case data send modem interpreted modem command switch normal command mode explained since usually done communication program modem use hayes command language command start character   hayes language uniform every manufacturer implement ation language particularly exotic thing mnp control document therefore give exact rule match modem figure command modem different mine  communication speed  said  communication speed   communication speed  purpose modem rated maximum speed somewhat misleading several speed involved final communication speed depends one factor modem speed measured bit per second bps number bit per second sent received modem telephone line common speed today bps used older cheaper modem becoming quite common may also hear term  modem baud rate  ignore measure number modem status change per second bps modem usually baud rate use special technique frequency shifting squeeze bit per change status modem speed bps refers phone side modem speed side modem computer necessarily mnp modem usually capable talking computer faster talk soon see necessary modemtocomputer modemtomodem speed different handshaking technique explained must used ensure computer  overrun  modem beyond actual capability vice versa complicate thing little bps speed measure actual number bit flow modem mnp effective transfer rate faster le bit needed transmit amount data one thing must remember actual transmission speed speed slowest communicating partner modem talk talk actual speed straightforward le obvious modem talk modem effective speed actually enhanced mnp computerto modem speed fixed final speed neither u may aware communication twopartners game may set speed correctly side good enough must set speed right well sysops pay attention whole world waiting setup communication parameter correctly  mnp basic  mnp microcom networking protocol today supported many brand beside microcom originally intended ensure errorfree communication modem regardless phone line condition mnp divided class first earliest class errorfree communication obtained price reducing effective speed quite obvious think newer class use special technique result errorfree data transfer actually increasing communication speed moderately considerably mnp class reduce transfer speed worth discussing mnp class first class resulted increased transfer rate done communicating modem using synchronous  packet  without start stop bit although data transfer side modem modem computer still synchronous still overhead involved effective transfer rate mnp byte per second bps modem compared byte nonmnp assuming start bit stop bit parity speed way ideal never reached limiting factor get quite close mnp class us synchronous packet well optimizes packet eliminating unnecessary data adjusting line condition effective transfer rate mnp byte per second assuming many error remember communication supposed errorfree well faster mnp class add data compression mnp realtime adaptive compression algorithm used mean modem adjust algorithm time match data transferred unlike previous class provide constant speed factor compression depends course data transmitted mnp considered effective rate make bps modem behave like catch however modem mainly file transfer bb chance gain much compression put word alreadycompressed zip ice etc file bb squeezed file compression method probably changed publication suggest would better without data compression case since compression price mean revoke mnp go back using mnp experience mnp harm file transfer much probably keep take care interactive bb work case might different feel free experiment let know result far go several mnp class latest one heard mnp make bps modem behave like idea modem mnp still common one thing nt say obvious mnp twoway business communicating modem must use mnp level communicate modem may negotiate agree upon certain level make first connection  speed thing basic idea  enough theory let start something useful thing make communication faster summarized follows purchase mnp modem least mnp probably purchase fastenough communication program cause bottleneck computer notice said  purchase   steal   borrow  make modem use mnp said nt good advise rather easy remember mnp modem use mnp default manual

make sure communication program stay high speed revert modem nominal speed connection made use hardwarelevel handshaking ctsrts modem communication program use xonxoff handshaking must make sure everything specified partial job end without gain speed better case unreadable garbage screen worse case  speed thing practical example  hardware part let assume purchased everex ev modem mnp recommendation may better bargain market also discus modem setup possibility software part may use communication program come bundled modem everex come something called  bitcom  much better bargain market shareware experiment purchase one like mention two telix seems like fairly good choice fast large builtin zmodem powerful script language annoying use telemate considered good choice since
