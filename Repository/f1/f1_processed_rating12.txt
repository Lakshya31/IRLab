editing grammar spelling sent core boxed set general comment                   original boxed set okay guess nt used campaigning yet would liked see interaction country various wonder toril rather buy module thoroughly enjoyed new edition fr box  personally thought well thought pretty good value money find module included nt good nt well planned little confusing place also disappointed fact  god system  god able die nt changed ed world really great started started thing like  avatar  series blew hell one person work world good idea consistency suffered quality allowed become uneven way many th mages spellusers running around ask  becoming  munchkinworld  bad base one everything could ask fr product good particularly care adventure module though general observation new edition campaign setting well  rereleases  second edition update fr material lot reprinting bought new fr campaign setting city splendor boxed set expecting fresh look place disappointed see much simply reprinted first edition stuff already nt actually play realm accessory mesh seamlessly campaign especially aurora catalogue draconomicon setting general worth wasting time every homemade campaign setting seen interesting really buy world buy ravenloft lot complaint forgotten realm list number many could applied tsr game world tsr originally announced fr  official ad world  stated future module would set basis got sucked buying original boxed set completely ignored promise module produced fr pathetic group invests boxed set brief sketch huge continent fine said sure tsr bring supplement detail various region detail mean detail small enough scale run campaign eg name description location inn road two close town first supplement seemed trying  supplement fxxxing print nt give damn main npc distant land mile waterdeep need know waterdeep silverymoon whole avatar mess sure ed greenwood cringes whenever hears fiasco tsr policy  take old stuff artwork shuffle give new name add box gouge  particularily evident fr product many time need buy map waterdeep many time need informed mirt stats stunning inconsistency always amazed keep generating totally inconsistent description major fr npc setting favourite example yawning portal stupid table size map hell supposed thing useless player  supposed know info useless size dm ever tried take peek foot map behind dm screen anyone tsr ever heard index summarize original boxed set waterdeep supplement adventure hardback bought anything tsr zero nothing year info obtained flipping store copy tsr product lie ripoffs forgotten realm turned company forever endless useless large type big margin handbook series product written ed greenwood definitely worth getting forgotten realm adventure              fra hardcover nice book  numerous  new  spell two page description map major town city info updating st edition ad character nd edition little dry read work well st edition set fr adventure book really handy lot neat info converting fr second edition spell section helped individualize realm even though many looked awfully familar one buried back st edition boxed set dm manual  plus add lot detail treasure unusual coin gem description problem someone bought reading avatar trilogy found reference fall avatar confusing however reading book thing lot clearer actually made even interesting another point want make like fact superpowerful class imo like barbarian etc well use psionics eliminated two thing bothered especially abused excessively player like  forgotten realm monstrous compendium mc mc                           fr mc supplement cool monster seemed specialized guess make ideal unique encounter sure seems like whole mc series seems emphasize unusual creature  generic  beasties dunno guess find odd much larger variety rare monster instead common one seems make much sense surface  mc general imho considered fr appendix fr mc hurt dinosaur neat nt use yet  meantime hard find critter want amid dinos fr mc good content looseleaf format updated new booklet format like planescape mystara monstrous compendium appendix mc nice  new  monster told rehash quite bit useless like saurials always nice monster throw around fr series     lot great stuff still use many supplement despite going second edition want cheap version city splendor boxed set get fr  pertinent information waterdeep dwarf deep awesome like early version  complete book  series used conjunction dwarf book one really flesh dwarf character one consistently good series tsr history bad product one associated particular land ie magister hall hero horde campaign magister hall hero old empire get higher rating little bit interesting spell rule bloodstone land pretty bad lack epic nature adventure liked module nt like campaign built around book good information either treated superficially spread haphazardly book draconomicon          well assembled nt contain lot real use pc ie dragon spell ca nt learn several page dragon hunting offer game term dragon artifact nothing bad offer pc assorted theory draconic evolution lot flesh dragon head offer idea module plot little actually add game little module end cute little use unless plan incorporate material use sidetreks tm bought draconomicon day ago seems interesting definitely nice second edition info tiamat bahamut big fan two player encounter dragon lot  though seems little watered place detailed  draconomicon drow underdark perfect campaign fr topnotch material drow underdark                 drow book cool period problem much information using fullest potential would probably justified basing entire campaign around underdark emphasis drow excellent pc drow andor campaign underdark thing missing ability avatar long take regain mr longtime surface dwelling drow atlas forgotten realm world                  atlas helpful helped piece map together plus little detail also nice see picture place mentioned various novel  atlas useful game play included detailed map region featured fr novel would great book aurora whole realm catalogue                actually give aurora catalogue scale darn good run buy everything perfectly captured feel early th century catalogue imitates aurora catalogue one best product tsr put long detail right amount fluff keep reading interesting informative catalogue great help fill annoying gap phrase  go store see sale  uh   add lot flavor shopping pc give good general idea exactly common people medieval setting would actually peddle everything ever wanted know price thing nt need item index though player guide forgotten realm pg                       player guide pretty awful experienced player already knew anyway expected lot player guide ended another copy main book setting boxed set tsr ashamed ever publishing player guide way childish poorly written elminster ecology           thing keep   fact cover shoud something paper good product enough said menzoberranzan boxed set             biased sorry love drow ca nt help sob enough provide good basis adventuring underdark though would liked see outer area le house statistic see tsr way ruin undermountain boxed set                 lot really really cool idea humonguous labrynthine layout unfortunately connection placed encounter though separate encounter happening vacuum see lich content sit one room never go bother bugbear hall full possibility although would liked see area fleshed  double criticism ruin undermountain ii deep level                      comparison first boxed set rouii poor many printing error even map big black space map bad description room undermountain ii nothing original much better set crap crap crap nothing crap anyone really interested page worth specific criticism place loaded error place error enough make unrunnable one section entitled wyllowwood map set room description simply disagree time perpetual war billing module  adventure use ad system  verge fraud since system aside unusable liked undermountain youll hate undermountain ii lot could say subject keep going probably start foaming mouth nasty thing keyboard checked indeed page specific criticism fortunately seizure typing page didnt read goth ruin undermountain ii deep level stink understand sequel bad cause really liked first one best adventure ever written opinion hope offending anyone except tsr ruin undermountain ii disgusting product ever seen  end
