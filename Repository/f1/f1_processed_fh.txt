fuckin hacker     af presentation written hypnocosm released june  fuckin hacker  overview fuckin hacker codehacking piece software anyone know much phreaking use program designed experienced phreak tool aid telephone endeavor save little money process fuckin hacker written used ibm pc xt clone course hayes compatible modem support baud real gain hacking speed higher anyway due lack higher baud dialups cpu speed limitation fuckin hacker offer wide range capability multiple dialup hacking using multiple target even long distance hacking feature hacker still lacking brute force program designed instead paranoid phreak living es worse need code yet must obtain little risk possible hacking multiple dialups sometimes ld service random target number riskfree way hack give ld company little indication hacking taking place reduces chance traced act put way one know ever busted using fuckin hacker fh short run fh sure file fhcom fh logged drive directory simply type fh ret fh create file need run leave disk drive quit fh setting fh first run read configuration disk file present created dropped main menu menu fh format choose menu option use arrow key press return option desire highlighted people color monitor see highlighted option different color rest menu monochrome display user see option two shade high low two shade apparent adjust level monitor thing become clear main menu option main menu hacker run hacker must configured modem extenders option function scanner yes fh carrier detect scanner also also requires configuration terminal basic terminal routine case find need nt like use procomm hacker piece communication software utility option need use first take utility menu spend time fh meat program quit quit fh return do stated choose option menu highlight option arrow key press return space bar first thing need configure next utility menu option utility menu configure modem take modem configuration misc parameter let set default command line parameter like begin end time printer io window etc edit extenders design extender configuration individually edit target store edit target edit valids valid code use ld hacking stored hacker automatically append good code find must updated checked validity extender flagging allows flag combination extenders hack edit exchange enter exchange want scan computer hack exchange flagging allows flag combination exchange scan quit main menu self explanatory setting run           first step go utility option hit return ok faced new challenge utility menu well let skip formality move go configure modem option hit return ok fix program run system arrow key numeric keypad flip around possible option nt numeric keypad well lousy keyboard still hit letter corresponding option end right place hit return space bar edit option comport set comport arrow key b maximum baud set baud maximum baud modem handle baud rate never exceeded matter setting extenders target baud rate  gee c local dialing set tone pulse set mode dialing program use dial home dialtone everything henceforth dialed tone case system cant handle dtmf  pbx dialing calling pbx system simply put yes option go one enter digit digit must hit outside line calling pbx need worry outgoing digit e outgoing digit valid option set yes number dialed locally pulse tone get local phone co dialtone case f initial string modem command string define sure valid want hacker initialize properly command modem make using program little better would suggest putting dialing speed advanced command set modem x example string would atxs would set modem detect busy voice line dial millisec delay ca nt think anything useful put set program initialize properly note program sends two initialization string modem first set response code numeric turn echo etc actual command string sent atmhevqss second string specify counteracts command modem initialize properly could bothered lot headscratching set initial string atz anything using command string use dialing speed turn advanced response code voice busy detect using baud modem support extra feature need command let modem return connect need set string atx something first builtin initialization string user modifiable modem trouble command may still get thing working hard way modify com file builtin string set something modem compatible nt suggest dont understand exactly go modify com file hey please copy anyone else think understand  g dialing delay either time delay dialtone detect dialtone detect modem use advanced command set w usr timed delay dialing done timer counting second suggest use timed delay even modem support advanced command set different modem different serial port tend give different result better stick sure deal h modem type set either external internal meaning internal modem set internal vice versa cause seems people internals major problem program sort fixed nt matter modem setting correct type get way program work internals whether set internal hack slowly modem trouble hanging set option internal speaker toggle default speaker program run silently option set nothing dramatic j response code finishing option response code response code brings menu list thing first different message modem sends terminal number next numeric code modem sends stand message understand reason nt think clear let explain way modem receives command string able execute without error sends numeric code mean  ok  standard number  ok  thus  ok  response code set get set default usr courier standard response code unless using th party modem bought libyan black market work make sure look response code owner manual modem note reason change response code modem simply message like voice busy etc since modem returning code program function normally never deal code sent however must change number message sent modem match code listed example modem return every time connects need set connect code instead rare likely never touch section program remember change code around message modem return matched right response code doesnt matter voice response code set modem never sends response code worry section k quit utils th command quit simply brings back utility menu go back utility menu continue lesson miscellaneous parameter             section set default command line parameter change value parameter running program command line parameter make easy tell program without flip menu also make easy run program batch file know bb every day early morning quits bb program batch file look certain errorlevel run fh using parameter set quit time etc return bb nothing ever happened parameter mean info use command line type  fh  syntax need use command line parameter set value saved default need use want something changed default value chosen vacation dialing option used conjunction begin end time hacker enabled program hack end time wait start time begin hacking use away week two set hack say hour   nt hack late night help le switchboard traffic better chance operator noticing bad code dialed b io window turn scrolling input output display top hacking scanning screen people think look neat others think slows thing turn please c printer setting value result good code carrier found scanner dumped printer discovered quit do option tell hacker scanner drop do end time reached allows batch file pick do prompt go wherever want errorlevels used pas message batch file think something want passed let know put e start time time want begin hacking scanning used either option enter time hr military format f quit time time want hacking scanning stop quit do enabled program exit do time reached vacation dialing enabled time reached hacking scanned cease message  waiting xx xx start time begin hacking scanning  appear g quit utils sends back utility menu asked want save value entered default want value every time run program answer   however liked default want change something one time answer  n  addingeditingdeleting extenders                 want add local dial ups extender file go edit extender option hit return big window middle screen thing modify extender want look command line menu possible command switch extender edit hitting arrow key said command line feel want modify one extenders extenderdat file come original arc one added hit arrow key till say number want edit type  e  edit edit flip different thing change  well might well go go area code one simple enough put area code extender right enter even number local area code never dialed wo nt information necessary dialing valid code understand b number another easy one might think phone number service wish hack digit long wish enter range number hit return entering first number range dash appear may enter last number range number within including number hacked want enter range simply hit return dash well c dial mode one set either local long distance set long distance dial extender good code validdat talk adding good code edit valids option little set local simply dial extender straight good use long distance hacking long distance service calling pbxs nt want show record note hacking automatically add extender dialing nt need mess anything set area code maximum baud let set highest baud rate extender support highest speed extender handle usually extender handle baud exception noisy service chance connecting better whatever baud set never exceed baud rate modem configuration option linked e minimum baud e minimum baud let set lowest baud rate extender hacked target baud rate limitation taken consideration matching extenders target concern possible target baud rate conflict dealing extenders send fake carrier set value something higher overcome problem may always work usually successful digit must hit order get outside line dialed code typical outgoing could anything else depends system f tone detect used conjunction dialtone detect configure modem section set configure modem section use option set individual extender since every extender give valid dialtones option applies modem support dialtone detect feature w g answer delay delay come extender code suggested set speaker listen extension test delay make sure allowing enough time extender answer dial code option f set wo nt use delay wait dialtone continuing h target delay time program wait carrier hanging modem going next try timer start target finished dialing might want turn speaker listen extension see delay long enough meaning target time answer delay run course set option n code know good test delay target prefix dialed target code put comma w dialtone detect j code first one either yes yes extender dialed code come target hand target come code k hack mode three possibility option random pick code try completely randomly like lottery sequential sound code next one tried like one pick code sequential order increment code random set according feel best situation l code length oh good easy one value many digit code code template used value ignored code template easily complex powerful option come code generation option override code length space blank code generated according length entered option anything entered code length forgotten code created according template careful devising work like make string consisting digit x character comma w character dialtone detection numerical digit  template present every code generated exact position comma template place code digit act pause dialing code system second dial tone second half code etc x character signifies variable digit entering code template like xxxxx would exactly setting code length leaving template clear hack mode apply also sample template would xxxx would useful want try making template hack pbx instead using pbx mode hacking would send digit code wait two second send outgoing wait two second dialing target perhaps xxxxxxx would hack calling card area code template except x entered exactly code sent modem dialing command string careful n starting code code use next time extender used modify order test delay responsible setting entering good code know make way connect sort see timed everything accurately code match code template set one rare actually extenders straightforward comma legal code extender depends code template must make starting code match template since first code generated template code file name file good code found particular extender stored suggest keep default extender extender cod feel free make whatever hell want extender dialed part range code file set number range nothing change p add valids real sure extender set option yes every good code found added onto validdat file good code kept code used dial long distance extenders timing critical target delay valid code must set perfectly work unless dialtone detect enabled extenders dial long distance recommended use option save little trouble though q note another easy one little string text use like small notepad something particular extender use name service owns nothing real important handy nevertheless flagged important one hacking program randomly pick extender hack next pas set wo nt included computer choice extenders thus nt want hack certain extender set option otherwise make sure yes want hack extender another option utility menu allows flagunflag every extender extender file much easier flipping extender changing dd new extender value default must remember flag want hack extender immediately quit return cursor command line continue thoroughly learned must know use   command command line must enter area code number code length hack mean real hack empty string eh must also know deleting extender extender longer service nt want list anymore hit proper arrowkey see extender screen want hit   delete extender prompt yes whether want delete type   removed form list otherwise stay list editadddelete target            edit target third option utility menu choose clear screen edit extenders except window middle screen smaller nt store much info extenderdat anyway command line command duh huh window see four thing area code simply put area code target b b number course target much else say c extra delay used conjunction target delay edit extender routine value second added target delay time whatever extender hacking main use ld target mean target long distance might take x second call get thus extra delay x option nt around would impossible make extenders work target default value zero unless target take unusually long time answer say british columbia something value remain zero maximum baud maximum baud target capable answering program compare max baud configure modem edit extender edit target one initialize hack lowest speed believe self explanatory wont explain e minimum baud minimum baud use target usually set happen find target wo nt connect set something higher remember matter set baud extenders target program never exceed baud rate modem configuration f quit edit option take back edit target command line   dd   elete edit extender routine need explaining better thing editadddelete valids            ok fourth option utility menu let pick see familiar clearing screen border command line appear top along small window one valid code used dial extender marked long distance may want add lot ld hacking different field follows number ok number extender oh use common sense course must local b code valid code number code template used extender use proper comma w valid code c dial code first ok another one yes option work like dial code first edit extender routine read nt bother already answer delay would think answer delay edit extender routine please look nt already forgotten already thank e target delay many second wait dialing target number case extender hacking dialing code since extenders time code dialed certain period time length must set precisely dialtone detect recommended note added answer delay whatever extender using actually recommend set modify answer delay edit extenders extender using f quit edit like every quit program take back previous menu case back command line find good code going want put list well rather simple type   add input information needed also code put going go bad time want delete rather simple type   command line hit   asks confirmation deleting flag extenders        ok next routine utility menu flag extenders allows toggle flag extender used hacking screen clear window appear middle screen menu list extenders extender file along  quit  option return utility menu lot extenders wont fit screen give option  next screen   previous screen  option according many extenders screen looking may use pgup pgdn key choose next previous screen option instantly anyway move top extender want flag unflag case may hit return arrow pointed extender flagged otherwise note save time mention right exchange flagging option behaves exactly like one flag exchange scan instead extenders hack edit exchange        enter exchange want scan carrier scanner editing system similar extender editing assume understand cd scanner work simply give explanation info must fill one area area code range scanning enter even nt long distance look good b exchange first three number number dialed range often referred prefix c start complete phone number start scanning enter last four digit first number want start dialing number increase scanning progress quit last four digit last number dial want scan number   would enter area option exchange option b start option c quit option confusing enough wait e dial mode tell program whether exchange long distance local use arrow key choose one number local exchange last digit start dialed call number long distance call first go service valid code section dial area code exchange last digit f timeout value second tell scanner long wait carrier dial set anything like recommend  second local number anywhere long distance exchange g flag yes flag exchange way flag extenders hack may want scan one exchange time set flag menu use exchange flagging next option utility menu flag combination quickly h quit edit sends back utility menu saving change made quit main menu         return main menu move better thing edited something routine nt save disk saved though everything saved second finish editing well time hit option return main menu continue tour hacking screen          explanation shit hacking screen mean status program going response dialed number attempt made since started success number good code found along ration dialed v success since started hacking baud baud program working call determined said lowest rate modem max extender max target max hackmode code generation extender hacking moment extender number extender hacking number phone number extender note extender note talked earlier code code trying shown attempt total attempt made extender hacking success success extender call made since hacking begun target phone number target using connect two others see hacking long distance using one extenders file validdat code code go along extender thing notice top right corner screen timer count delay top left corner time date noticed window small list command say hit   toggle speaker onoff hit space bar cycle onto next pas hitting escape key abort hacking return main menu set program quit do aborted keypress quit do option ignored really let closing remark quit do      pick option say time hacking quit time rolled around program stop hacking leave hacking window show credit clear screen quit do batch file regain control dump code printer whatever want option put someone wanted hack night parent woke nt want hacker screen bitched left computer none wiser although situation may apply usefulness batch file take running hacker justifies option idiosyncrasy        every program quirk inform one program well would nt exactly call quirk like little unmentioned thing tip hit arrow key flip around menu unless say otherwise also type letter option highlighted hitting esc move back previous menu keypresses buffered like hell think nt press hard enough wait second two sure punch bad boy sometimes surprised find flipping wildly menu quit do option enabled scanner hacker drop do program finish hacking scanning mean timer case scanner last number dialed aborting hacker scanner keypress disable quit do option hitting space bar editmenus allow change option hit return home end pgup pgdn key serve familiar function place menu jump top bottom bottom top edit command line jump first last extender target valid whatever try em need change dat file around sometimes quickest delete whole goddamn thing example fucked around response code forgot set back  program create new file find one missing make first record default value whatever file deleted configdat run program say creating configdat go configure modem however response code set default value  nt afraid delete wow could sworn little thing well
