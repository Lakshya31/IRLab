kick button first win contest thus hop kick usually triumph jumpkick hit button time person jumped last win contest good game probably seems like common sense remember improved greatly upon learning also applies jumppunches aerial special move overridden thing  kung lao torpedo kick usually come top move always jump back kick late kick kung lao torpedo kick baraka aerial move fantastic making shortage special move nearly impossible uppercut air even jumpkick air except snes version  turnaround kick devestating jump someone jump kick nt hit kick button passed head lead interesting combo  follow scorpion teleport punch raiden torpedo good result people seeing jump try uppercut uppercut turnaround kick well almost one consistently proper response one block attack kick special type punch commonly referred  heavy punch  rediculously hard get worth trouble opponent jumpkicks press hp must lined punch properly timed hard fall punch take damage uppercut appearently heavy punch hit several time rather also knock opponent way air followed almost move except kitana fan lift many painful combo done heavy punch note seen one person every time get time
