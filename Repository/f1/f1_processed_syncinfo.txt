introduction tapemidi sync mqx dave hocker copyright c right reserved music quest inc overview since introduction music quest mqx enhanced midi coprocessor card music quest fielded large number question feature mqx various different form tapemidi sync purpose paper discus common form sync use computermusicmidi system particular emphasis tape sync look sync method implemented also consider relative strength weakness complete reading paper basic understanding different sync method good perspective sync feature music quest mqx pc midi interface hopefully answered many question simultaneously providing enough information ask new one type sync going discus four different type sync midi sync fsk frequency shift keying cl chase lock sync smpte society motion picture television engineer discussion treat midi sync differently three method mainly tape sync technique per se near end paper discus various converter convert one sync source tofrom another basic concept getting detail sync method need get basic belt first let make sure understand general reason sync term sync used refer various technique allow multiple time dependent device work together midiists usually mean want sync multiple midi device together want sync tape recorder one midi device second reason probably common circumstance used overcome shortage sound generator synthesizer allows create finished performance reusing sound generator separate track make several pass tape recording new track pas synchronizing always one master one slave good analogy conductor orchestra conductor master sync source keep orchestra musician together another sync basic draw conductor analogy one role conductor set tempo orchestra conductor us hisher baton  clock  faster baton move faster tempo vice

machine typically fsk us two distinctly different tone form sync signal eg hz hz one tone used fill tape second used mark occurrence clock signal tape read sync device generates clock signal every time see transition fill signal mark signal hence two tone form binary tape encoding fsk sync found many mputype pc midi interface stand alone sequencer drum machine also capable writing reading fsk one advantage fsk written various degree clock resolution example mputype fsk write sync track midi clock resolution tick per beat resolution mpu internal clock tick per beat practical application fsk sync several draw back since purely binary signal containing position information always start beginning sync track fsk sync counterpart midi song position pointer fsk nature frequency sensitive reliability greatly affected tape quality tape speed volume level finally since fsk contains position information error recovery tape drop out difficult chase lock sync quite simply cl described concept midi sync applied tape mean cl tempo relative sync method unlike fsk cl use tone instead us wave form much like used computer tape drive sync information written onto tape series bit included sync information song position pointer midi clock thus sync track read back possible locate exactly tape positioned starting place sync track usually sync device read position information form midi song position pointer message sends sequencer sequencer responds spp  chasing  current sequence location indicated spp hence term chase lock sync allowing time sequencer  chase  sync device sends midi continue initiate sequencing cl one major short coming namely clock resolution tick per beat however draw back greatly shadowed cl chase capability use cl appropriate sequencer play record location tape unlike fsk start beginning tape another plus cl encoding technique facilitates excellent recovery tape drop out summary cl significant step forward fsk smpte three tape sync method discussed smpte one true standard exists course midi also true standard also fixed time sync method originally smpte developed motion picture television work however shall see utility widened application smpte us electrical signal similar cl sync information written string bit however smpte us concept  frame  instead midi concept song position pointer midi clock smpte frame group bit describe single location tape called frame address number bit make frame rate bit written tape number frame per second dependent smpte format u two frame format frame per second used time format use frame bit long written rate bit per second frame address contains complete time stamp term hour minute second frame number often see written form hh mm s fr thus  identifies frame address frame hour minute second completely new topic watch mtv occasionally see video smpte console showing rolling frame address cheap trick video  flame  good example overall four standard smpte format frame used motion picture frame used europe video work television scan rate frame per second frame nondrop format used world wide audio sync frame drop format used u video work u color television us scan rate  frame per second

fsk cl decide want different tempo set tempo must rewrite tape smpte appropriate sequencer change tempo time without necessity rewriting sync track third like cl tape sync start reading smpte track location smpte encoding scheme also greatly facilitates recovery tape drop out finally smpte used trigger mechanism power simplicity example using smpte easy visualize starting sequence location  ie
