texas network security package overview  dave safford doug schales dave hess abstract last august texas university unix computer came extensive attack coordinated group internet cracker package security tool represents result seven month development testing software using protect estimated twelve thousand internet connected device package includes three coordinated set tool  drawbridge  exceptionally powerful bridging filter package  tiger  set convenient yet thorough machine checking program  netlog  set intrusion detection network monitoring program program undergone extensive testing modification use consider beta test release external review documentation still preliminary brief history incident tuesday august notified ohio state specific tamu machine used attack one computer internet local machine turned sun workstation faculty member office unfortunately faculty member town week rather trying convince department head let u without faculty present decided monitor network connection workstation necessary disconnect machine net electronically decision monitor machine session rather immediately securing turned fortunate monitoring gave u wealth information intruder method initial monitoring tool simple significance seeing became apparent rapidly improved tool point able watch intruder entire session real time keystroke keystroke monitoring led discovery several outside intruder involved many local machine compromised one local machine even set cracker bulletin board machine cracker would use contact discus technique progress thursday august felt enough information machine compromised broken could effectively clean addition severity modification intruder making particularly bulletin board machine made imperative stop intrusion contacted respective system manager arranged shut machine scheduled system cleanup next day friday august worked known affected machine closing security hole used break brought back network saturday august received emergency call one system manager saying intruder broken back cracker bulletin board machine concerned integrity research data asked machine physically disconnected rest network monday august analyzed log new breakin determined cracker much sophisticated led believe many local machine user account compromised initially knew even found file containing hundred captured password appeared actually two level cracker high level sophisticated thorough knowledge technology low level  foot soldier  merely used supplied cracking program little understanding worked initial response based watching later le capable cracker insufficient handle sophisticated one much deliberation decided way protect computer campus block certain key incoming network protocol reenabling local machine case case basis machine cleaned secured problem cracker access even one unsecure local machine could used base attack assume machine compromised unless proven otherwise recommendation filter incoming traffic presented associate provost computing monday afternoon approved bought borrowed necessary equipment filter monitor machine late afternoon worked night design coding filter particular effort made design achieve necessary security minimum impact local user filter completed installed pm tuesday september thursday september monitor log showed obviously automated attack ftp sequentially probing every machine campus decided monitor attack unsure could accomplish decision observe rather immediately block turned fortunate shortly midnight friday notified cert another site monitoring machine noticed cracker broken back machine immediately went analyzed log determined cracker used ftp install program allowed tunnel past filter block addition cracker installing sophisticated trap door trojan program throughout large number machine apparently ensure never locked system modification particularly nasty went great pain conceal including patching modified binary match original timestamps checksum point completely redesigned filter keep cracker installed new version saturday new version providing much greater security also unfortunately visible valid user good news new filter interrupted new sophisticated cracker working apparently anticipate rapid response discovered one machine still megabyte cracker tool captured information provided u detailed information yet cracker method since new filter installed observed successful intrusion attack machine despite continued logging probe continued attempt log one incident local student trying attack campus machine another topic effort since centered three area improving filter largely ease use throughput improving monitoring tool reduce manpower requirement developing program help local system manager check machine proper security configuration response overview response intrusion incident three major thrust filtering monitoring cleaning first line defense bridging filter package drawbridge used filter packet internet drawbridge allows u control internet access machine machine port port basis full ethernet bandwidth basis firewall configuration known stronger drawbridge provides level compromise security availability acceptable university environment provides much needed flexibility throughput large scale network realizing drawbridge compromise convenience security developed set monitoring tool look intrusion might attempting circumvent filter tool monitor internet link continuously checking unusual connection pattern connection wide range specific intrusion signature finally developed tiger script tool helping system administrator check configuration security status individual machine following diagram show overview filter monitor implementation traditional secure gateway filter secure bastion host used traffic internet forced typically mean user need proxy client external access telnet ftp log bastion host external access case filter allows arbitrary protocol filtering host host basis department set authorized host service configuration subject campus wide minimum standard provides reasonable level security flexibility educational research requirement host enabled beyond default incoming permission mail must pas thorough tiger script described later monitor node placed outside filter record connection attempt blocked filter placement crucial recognizing intrusion attack place monitor risk minimize risk placed filter monitor controlled access machine room configured monitor accept network request validated monitor request filter similarly programmed respond

requirement particularly need supporting potentially different filtering roughly  machine class b network complex router addition needed something could handle full ethernet bandwidth secure could implemented rapidly brent chapman presented interesting analysis limitation current filter implementation  network security ip packet filtering  proceeding third unix security symposium september drawbridge program along support filter specification language compiler address critical recommendation respect functionality ease specification decided pc two smc aka western digital ethernet card based first software implementation pcbridge vance morrison initial version soon rewritten scratch turbo c make addition needed feature somewhat easier current filter design provides  allow  based filtering per host separate incoming outgoing permission allow based filtering prohibits connection except explicitly allowed performance configuration management filter table created support workstation based powerful filter configuration language securely transferred filter machine either boot time dynamically operation support machine hard work parsing configuration file looking address building table filter need perform simple table lookup run time updating table dynamically made secure de authentication current default configuration allows outgoing connection allows smtp mail several campus departmental server checked set host able receive incoming telnet ftp nntp gopher request monitor goal monitoring record security related network event intrusion attempt detected tracked difficult problem general communication data rate make problem somewhat like trying take sip water fire hose campus terabyte internal data transfer per day internet connection order ten gigabyte per day average  individual connection period clearly selective flexible monitor need automated tool reviewing even resultant log another problem monitor placement important monitor placed critical segment observed monitor secure solution includes program  tcplogger   udplogger   etherscan  associated support program tcp udp logger basically log one line summary connection attempt associated analysis program report suspicious connection pattern connection addition log useful analyzing detail security event fact etherscan program go much actually scanning packet content looking specific set intrusion signature root login attempt campus detail intrusion signature well etherscan program discussed detail contains sensitive information technique want widely distributed machine cleanup tiger script third major thrust development automated tool checking given machine sign intrusion network security related configuration item resultant tool actually set bourne shell script high portability major goal tiger script provide simple way check machine prior allowing level greater internet connectivity ease use tiger script label output error classificatio n  fail  problem found extremely serious  warn  problem found may serious require human inspection  info  possible problem found change configuration suggested  error  test able performed reason checking performed cover wide range item including item identified cert announcement item observed recent intrusion script use xerox cryptographic checksum program check modified system binary possible trap door trojan well presence required security related patch currently tiger script configured sunos x solaris  svr nextstep  unicos  release program largely table driven ease porting working port ultrix aix sgi etc policy policy procedure need provide security flexibility resultant decision filter incoming traffic mail machine allow case case request authorized host status based successful demonstration basic security configuration tiger script special case request allowing incoming request special server easily checked embedded robot controller case allowed connection implemented special monitor service long term policy question remain unanswered include handle update response critical cert announcement handle o update obviously need way coordinate periodic quick response host review filter configuration language support machine class could something  disable ftp sunos  machine  response cert announcement respective problem would nice mechanism communicate announcement respective manager cutting access problem large campus maintaining contact list large number machine given high rate turnover student manager addition information filter configuration file may rapidly become outdated
