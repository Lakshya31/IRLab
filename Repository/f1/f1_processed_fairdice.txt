chisquared goodnessoffit test deleted since allan asks correction fine point attempt limit major problem intended flame allan fairly important stuff explained correctly stage get le pleasant please accept apology advance calculation allan describes give correct value chisquare goodnessoffit statistic call  indicator  wary interpreting result way describes explain let u assume dice unknown

chisquare test  real world  dice  later post allan correct test around lot longer test due karl pearson nearly year old surprise allan find real dice biased impossible make truly fair die obviously close enough nt care much chance getting  close fair  decrease number side ii allan testing method call quarter fair dice assuming existed biased even fairest dice could buy good chance called biased actually use program made roll dice stats unfortunately nobody party want use dice roll invariably end better think must pseudorandomness program anyone know better would nt want use computer generated dievalue playing ad thrill  rolling die  part game also reference player favourite diedice due inherent bias found real dice trick find dice biased beyond reasonable playability response michael g wright michael discovery handrolled dice often come better could occur couple reason player tend hang  favourite  dice  roll well  ie come good result biased dice chance concentrating hand player long nt extreme probably nt matter much allan quite correctly identifies reason ii player nt really roll randomly fairly long email discussion sea wasp topic recently even unconciously pick dice  nonrandom  fashion good roll tend followed another good roll nt roll tooo vigorously may notice bad roll player tend throw harder may problem player much better others becomes noticeable may wish invest dice cup mock crapstable affair allan comment  trick find dice biased beyond reasonable playability  spot exactly correct remember come back later think discussion also answer paul kinsler

way well fact allan suggestion use roll per cell use roll roll case never decide die actually fair test get result close expected die fair lack evidence hypothesis fairness default assumption statistical test biasedness die  null hypothesis  get either higher degree evidence hypothesis fairness getting result unlikely fair die low degree evidence fairness like court case criminal case defendant assumed innocent proven guilty innocence null hypothesis evidence defendant presented prosecution jury decides either  guilty  strong enough evidence  guilty  nt declare innocence ca nt determine  fairness  anyway question need ask die biased hundred roll whatever number enough u good chance pick difference time  convicting innocent  often whether enough depends big difference think

give calculation two different number throw per cell different post ought able generalise calculation given allan may longer available indication calculation given roll die many time say time per face

however much worried kind deviation others example interested knowing   came often knowing   came often first could affect play substantially second probably little use test better chance pick kind deviation fairness important u trade le chance picking deviation le concerned let u consider complete example imagine two like test fact unknown u following percentage probability row face number prob st die prob nd die                 fair die would right across course dice obtained relabelling face first die reasonable play course nt try roll exactly exactly le greater first die never one twentieth required probablility eg probability le  instead either direction correct average almost correct standard deviation difference tiny second die would unbalancing play  chance rolling higher time likely mean almost standard deviation also thats relatively unimportant chisquared rate equally bad good test likely identify second die might prepared sacrifice ability pick first since make little practical difference play said come back point note almost deviation important different value lesser extent stick chi squared test many test want present one test say properly applied chisquared good test closely tailored specific question interest even better two test count  test based histogram  kolmogorovsmirnov test collect data chisquared test point start calculation lay like could run rather across roll   count   expected   add count expected count writing partial total go roll   count   expected   sum count   sum exp   find difference without sign sum count   sum exp   difference   last difference zero nt work final column still would check divide largest difference largest difference calculation see number roll made altogether test statistic let call value look book nonparametrics table however would better use table reason discus second multiply square root number roll equivalently divide largest difference square root number roll compare     value apply pretty well irrespective   total number roll would use   least roll per face   note also value come simulation   hence exact nt really matter interpret suggested chisquare test may find following value table   irrespective number side die reason larger based assumption distribution data continuous effectively large number face die would give value use textbook value test conservative fair die reject slightly le often supposed table due distribution value discrete generates integer anything example assume larger difference made roll hence expected number cell   get table look made roll could use table square root x   much le value little evidence die unfair test probably even appropriate two chisquared k enough get good idea suspect dice note suspect die decide test nt use roll made suspect test generate new set eg recording roll play one player result look funny nt test recorded value generate new set                                     testing die based histogram roll histogram approach turned test sort follows drawing histogram line drawn either side expected mean result histogram bar lie within inner line strong evidence bias bar go outside outer line fairly clear evidence bias one bar lie inner outer line mild evidence bias really clear may wish perform test probability individual side described next section testing individual face several bar lie inner outer line stronger indication bias draw line worked value rolling time face example time time bar histogram must actually go past value could think value giving  acceptable range  literally acceptance region histogram fair die give histogram one bar outside range time respectively actually table throw per face approximate formula let n total number roll   let c number face die   let e expected number time   face come e nc   line go e  x sqrt e c c   value come table fraction rounded eg n c e give   sqrt x     sqrt x   table go approximate formula   due   extreme tail   distribution combined   slight asymmetry   range get   sometimes bit big deal example throw time record result table draw inner line outer line well reference line histogram    count    count horizontal line nt quite correct position ought quarter half character position lower count                                                                          face count  one value go outside value technically could say go outside acceptance region seems dice biased particularly roll many whether affect game much another point     however perhaps would result large effect game testing individual face suspect particular face coming wrong frequency wish test particular face eg throw compare narrower range however ca nt use data made suspect face test must generate new set roll eg histogram find result look odd ca nt use number test case range given testing entire histogram appropriate table need exceed range given call die probably biased nt know direction already twotailed test doubt use table rather next one table throw per face approximate formula reasonably accurate let n total number roll   let c number face die   let e expected number time   face come e nc   line go e   x sqrt e c c   e   x sqrt e c c   fraction rounded eg n c e give   sqrt x   rounded   sqrt x   rounded think particular face coming often think particular face nt coming enough onetailed test table throw per face approximate formula reasonably accurate let n total number roll   let c number face die   let e expected number time   face come e nc   line go e   x sqrt e c c   e   x sqrt e c c   fraction rounded eg n c e give   sqrt x   rounded   sqrt x   rounded value given eitheror ie since already specified particular direction compare higher value lower value example decide test new see roll correct number nt believe biased particular direction roll time time get    twotailed  table see outside outer range seems roll many example another player seems rolling lot decide test whether come often roll time get following since decided test many see number exceeds ca nt say generating data  oh actually perhaps roll one   perhaps roll many  without generating new set data new hypothesis must never base testing spy set
