substantive demand third party risk victim considered high officer aware incident likely end peaceful resolution hyams cabano dang threatened actually injured victim made substantive demand despite effort negotiator demand could tied release victim hostage used bargaining chip obtain something else time incident lack threat directed toward victim substantive demand made although law enforcement officer may believe dealing hostage situation actually pseudohostage incident example husband threatens wife handgun run neighbor house call police officer arrive advises yearold son house husband contact husband informs angry wife concern go away leave alone make demand threaten safety son case absence substantive demand threat toward child coupled absence highrisk factor indication responding officer risk son probably relatively low action criterion decisionmaking key question managing hostagebarricade incident authorize tactical intervention rescue hostage impossible determine exact likelihood surrender reasonable conclude number highrisk factor increase chance negotiated resolution decrease however important difference decreased chance surrender chance surrender suggesting negotiated surrender impossible onscene commander immediately authorize assault  case successfully negotiated even though highrisk factor present example february montgomery county kentucky john delay became distraught lost custody dispute pulled gun meeting wife son social worker threatened kill demanded police put weapon come room speak police negotiated outside room hour released hostage surrendered even substantial number highrisk factor present risk hostage law enforcement officer might judged even greater rescue attempt involves assault hand one subject  risk effective  tactical option positive outweigh negative available option might considered earlier would situation without factor personnel special operation research unit developed concept  action criterion  assist making command decision affirmative answer made three key question prior critical decision made action necessary particular action contemplated onscene commander responding either internal external pressure  something  still early incident might action successful later time action contemplated time rejected hour ago reconsidered onscene commander feeling pressure resolve incident even though change circumstance action  risk effective  although hostage rescue involves risk objective appraisal likelihood casualty victim law enforcement officer must made suppose example one victim held subject armed automatic weapon location one entry point available tactical team leader estimate take second enter stronghold external diversion possible decide subject would time shoot victim still confront tactical team negotiation team leader belief based subject past history assaulted subject open fire rather surrender situation surely dynamic entry would reduce risk hostage instead would substantially increase risk hostage officer entering stronghold action professionally acceptable action taken legally acceptable professionally ethical usually legal aspect easiest resolve ethical moral consideration may much difficult example august monthold boy swallowed balloon cutting air supply child severe brain damage irreversible coma life support system month according doctor little chance ever regaining consciousness april boy father armed handgun entered hospital room ordered medical personnel room disconnected life support equipment held son arm cry son died case one option might shoot father order prevent son dying action may legal ethical consideration action make decision much difficult conclusion risk victim hostagebarricade incident vary considerably depending either presence absence many factor including discussed article perceived risk well risk involved particular tactical option primary consideration onscene commander decision authorize tactical action decision made onscene commander evaluate presence highrisk factor consider intelligence available combine information assessment made negotiation tactical team combined information assist commander differentiating genuine hostage situation pseudohostage situation intended homicide incident contemplated action reviewed context action criterion prior final decision made reviewing highrisk factor
