petros station buzzing activity destruction cyberian platform death amoko caused short hysteria krael worked quickly taking initiative told four admiral cyberian armada would welcome petros station could transfer flag admiral armada refused offer fact named krael amoko successor director cyberian group krael set building new fighter heavy cruiser armada equipped pergiumsteel frame polarcrystal shielding proved effective kazik plasma weapon also ordered equipped powerful energy unit would better chance survival krael knew needed erect similiar shielding device station also four command ship armada fund required build item available krael asked every empire galaxy send donation even given shielding company called target shielding agreed shield three hundred thousand fighter armada krael knew measure would give fighting chance survival nt sure enough one chapter admiral rytek made commanderinchief krael request told krael nt feel enough experience command armada asked rytek perform task rytek taken rein alot work deploying fighter heavy cruiser strategic place knew little kazik military position kazik could become invisible fact alone allowed strike anywhere wished also alot work reorganizing fleet completely refurbished krael managed get fund build five heatsoliton emitter four mounted command ship mounted petros station idea krael scrounged get money expensive endeavor rytek personally suspected krael shut petros extrauniversal exploration program compensate new massive military spending rytek work cut wildcat empirial representative cyberian group organization

nodded thoj always knew wanted  want u use polarcrystal grid  demanded admiral rytek thoj image least nodded  inspector tecouk belief kazik pergium converter go right polarcrystal grid  explained rytek sighed spending much money developing new defensive grid told might work  alright make necessary change  said chapter steco leader relief fleet krael given order send small envoy hcs back new
