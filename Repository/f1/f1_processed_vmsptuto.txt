people avoid using system operator warning useridoperatorall msg warning command class b sends highpriority message designated user user system message interrupt anything currently done unlike message command wait terminal inpu displayed help facility         vmssp system extensive help facility give information every command system along many program compiler etc may resident system helpful ever stified format certain command get help certain command try help command nt provide anything also aid facility point towards help broader subject combination help aid help make vmssp one userfriendly operating system around help even give information privileged command rscs networking          vmssp system use method networking computer together known rscs using rscs name system job run disconnect mode system transmit file user message mail print job etc remote computer r c machine given command perform task user looking computer see logged etc command transmitted smsg rscs command instance wanted see logged onto remote compu ter called fritz would issue following command smsg rscs cmd fritz query name information rscs command always check help aid facility system disk       system usually disk automatically attached session log likely located mode u w disk contain various external command like external command msdos important p rograms editor xedit compiler etc must careful
