speed kart time firing shell outrun firing kart stationary moving slow velocity course also depends top speed pursued kart q keep getting butt kicked battle mode suck well  record game record sheet see red shell kill opponent object red shell get better chance even opponent better shooter shaker bottom line get significantly red shell end top basically get object red shell lose ample free question mark try course good idea green shell opponent red shell nearby q fast takeoff soon hear first beep see light hit hold accelerator nt hit tap accelerator light light motor running first light hit hit accelerator slightly later usual fast takeoff q could sworn shell went right opponent bug jump shell jump shell banana peel shell hit must centered back kart often happens shell appear come directly kart record play back animation see shell pas slightly center behind always case however time firing shell shell kart pas right opponent fire shell collide opponent shell going opponent likely bug q cool partner picked lakitu put back track green shell nt know lakitu put seems certain magic spot cloud drop past certain mark always advance next magic spot clockwise even closer one counter clockwise keep mind see lakitu go partner location face right follow lakitu enough get good shot seems exception two karts picked lakitu placed magic spot case one kart go nearest magic spot clockwise nearest magic spot counterclockwise q seems question mark placed randomly match least turn machine especially track battle mode question mark placed saved permanent location q determines question mark get reset nt know maybe question mark taken except one puddle track certain amount time transpired q long shell peel last varies able determine make shell last longer others may active player many item playing field q long invisibility last second q long invincibility last second q best strategy evasive opponent got star get close possible preferably open area make sure free question mark nearby enable star power mode immediately start getting object get red shell may set least hit combo opponent hit opponent correctly kart remember superior braking power star hit opponent full speed always break avoid flying past opponent trying cute slowing let pas hit brake line charge wo nt know hit q hit opponent correctly star power combo hit opponent slightly thrown waste time turning around come another hit may give opponent enough time get away almost time charge full speed head straight possible may get multiple hit one pas otherwise come slowly hit turn kart slightly hit think combo cheap say rare opponent equal chance another  feature  mastered q somehow got red shell circle oh boy tough one got respond immediately give opponent time get another shell ram slow enough might want try build speed inside encompassing area shell created make break wall soon red shell pass front may get lucky able get question mark inside circle worse come worse get hit avoid comboed opponent q red shell tail several thing outrun line wall jump wall last possible moment drop shell banana peel one try obtain item virtually item get able help thing ca nt help red shell wiggling moving fast jump like crazy shell often get confused make sharp turn come around another pas hopefully turn lead wall importantly center track red shell coming head nearest wall full speed nt stop turning jumping line wall time accurately q shoot red shell coming right head got shell green red wait last possible nanosecond firing shell red shell kill perfectly lined work although lined earlier fire shell intercept firing red shell still best wait last possible moment might rear miss target q karting kombat continue sequel far nintendo report working plan create sequel however wacky karts slated release ibm pc although different character appear mode graphic combat game play seem watch although said stunt race fx expected sequel super mario kart two really different game especially battle mode   vii tip tactic   practice firing green shell turn angle send straight corridor practice making turn without slowing hitting wall best way make turn hit jump button coming turn turn direction sometimes may need jump practice lining wall fly get hit shell hold gas hit jump button seems hitting jump button break dizzy spell quicker making jump turning hold jump button angle try track start circle jump hold button release button notice kart straighten little keep mind red shell pursued use advantage make quick remember nt fully turned around shell turn around possible drop shell peel top sitting opponent shell peel remember ca nt spinout invincible learn tell music exactly invincibility run near opponent shoot shell hit shell pas right opponent sitting right next opponent whether sideways behind etc fire shell shell pas right opponent careful firing red shell like undoubtedly cause loop around hit immune red shell fired opponent fired red shell standing still moving slowly might want try whip opponent hope red shell coming around pas hit following take path hit opponent usually happen every couple round use color map quickly locate opponent move kill counterclockwise red yellow green blue manual come cartridge useful hint listed page  battle mode tactic tip racing tip      power slide slow kart rather efficient turn drive outside track take turn close inside like formula racing perfect dont slide hit wall think ca nt make speed going try letting go gas better yet tap gas slow kart yet still keep fastest speed coming turn recommend using yoshi princess best result race mode learned track donkey kong bowser best top speed hitting opponent wall costly bound happen cc cc race beginner stick koopa toad easiest handle recover crash quickly practice practice practice learn turn anticipate kart best turn   viii nt   nt pursue opponent open area track star red shell suicide practice opponent estimate invincibility run music opponent fire shell still invincible hit right invincibility run giving time make escape either pursue reasonable amount time intelligently obtain item fire opponent nt hold ghost indefinitely opposing player continue jumping avoiding question mark although probably somewhat cheap sometimes advisable use feather wait opponent invincibility puddle got ghost pursuit opponent enabled star power suggest holding onto case opponent get red shell otherwise near use avoid capture nt underestimate red shell thought lost fast moving red shell get hit minute corner later nt ever give even opponent waiting red shell brought water lakitu jump like crazy wall surprised avoid sometimes soon norm avoid red shell rather get hit   ix varying game play   contest see kill first hint green shell banana peel go full speed wall hit wall drop shell peel done right bounce wall shell peel killing allow use red shell vary item use tweak aiming skill spinout use star continue drive straight kart turned side steer get star build much speed possible get feather jump water track land keep driving yes drive underwater see far drive hip hop tile track hold puddle water right hop tile corner bounce backwards hopping tile backwards sometimes continue several hop practice red shell chase tail practice red shell loop immobile opponent hit jump die make kart jump dead adinfinitum die nt release gas button instead
