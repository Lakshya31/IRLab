faq frequently asked question q try create vehicle trooper computer uhuhs vehicle trooper icon covered sign  due fact using production facility cant create quota unit unit soldier trooper squad vehicle quota varies mission mission eg atriedes last level unit solution send weaker vehicle eg tank get rid quad trike etc map enemy structure process get destroyed use empty vehicle slot create stronger unit ii build starport certainly pc version  dune ii  create unit buy extra unit starport however nt hold true sega version sega version effectively starport alternative vehicle factory may allow purchase cheaper vehicle perhaps ornithopter main us playing ordos need starport order get missile launcher b need starport order build palace q try create structure find selection dropped wall concrete  due fact fixed number structure map one time however gotten stage maximum number building need worry little must new building destroy one old building create new one advised death hand opposing enough trouble keeping structure standing however good destroy rocket turret move forward let defence  roll  forward expand remember make mistake need replace one building another make unit attack one building q stop computer rebuilding rocket turret destroyed  simple answer destroy computer construction site rebuild building though repair really answer try leaving heavy tank two siege tank beside destroyed turret like tt tturret ttank good position attack well tank close fired upon missile able attack turret side turret attack tank time turret rebuilt damaged placed bare rock even easier destroy another slightly complex method suggested pc faq build concrete turret destroy lay concrete build turret place never tried wo nt vouch note build enemy concrete q give order carryall ornithopter  ca nt ornithopter automatically attack enemy base carryall whatever judged appropriate computer pick harvester pickup damaged vehicle etc q get carryall  carryall used transport harvester spice field used carry damaged vehicle repair facility useful people think q carryall return harvester field picking dropping refinery  usually course notice thing stop working carryall must  learn  harvester harvesting returned unloading harvested spice two thing disrupt le carryall harvester two need taken back one returned deployed next refinery must send deployed one back spice field manually happen le two refinery b field harvesting spice left deployed next refinery must set harvesting manually q defend death hand missile  defend death hand missile  anyway way getting around problem destroyed base spread base start game way missile hit wo nt destroy many building get properly established disadvantage making base difficult defend beginning vehicle b build buy mcv replace construction yard get destroyed better yet incorporate second construction site base early game keep two far apart one hit destroy c nt let harkonnen unit get within sight base missile hit chance much lower achieve build rocket turret well away base direction harkonnen defend tank build another construction yard far away another rock section possible first one way main one get destroyed missile start targeted newly built one get breathing room rebuild e send large contingent vehicle take computer palace quickly possible q use high tech factory get carryall new refinery need ornithopter  high tech factory useful go back look vehicle factory high enough mission allows build house weapon devastator sonic tank deviator also allows build ornithopter later level atreides ordos yes get carryall refinery need extra lift damaged vehicle extra harvester ornithopter useful apart else attack progress turret fire ornithopter first leave ground troop alone base without turret say destroyed construction yard attack rest base ornithopter sufficient destroy whole thing given time note send ornithopter base heavily defended rocket turret chance wo nt last long q defend ornithopter  build rocket turret soon firstly provide excellent defence enemy vehicle secondly unit chance destroying ornithopter nt worry seems take long time destroy ornithopter remember moving fast take quite shot get hit take one hit destroy however patient repair whatever attacking also nt worry missile miss hit building repair damage quickly build rocket turret must build radar outpost depending mission may upgrade construction yard defending ornithopter keep close eye vehicle factory b repair facility seem favoured target q worth trying steal spice  general fairly pointless silo damaged  red  send set soldier capture generally attacked immediately surrounding enemy destroyed short space time q many refinery generally create  nt overdo later game best build maybe refinery buy extra harvester two build silo instead good reason take le space cost le hold unit le spice use le power however start level build refinery get unit storage harvester le power consumption great price level face death hand missile definitely two refinery far apart destroyed one hit imagine early game hit lose construction site refinery game recover however still refinery least chance get enough credit buy mcv use continue building assuming still vehicle factory course q many vehicle factory build  generally one enough occasionally may useful thing remember create unit whatever limit may mission must wait vehicle destroyed building use two vehicle factory quick start long run save money one enough q get repaired unit transported back picked  build repair centre position ensures building placed around ie      ooooo  building  orrro  r repair centre  orrro  stuff  ooooo        position also taken vehicle pretty pointless wall cheaper even trike mean way vehicle get repair centre using carryall make sure already made repair centre completely surrounded damaged vehicle brought repaired instead deployed next centre carryall come take back spot originally picked happen without worry might lose carryall enemy fire lifting damaged unit thats small risk really compared getting automatic repair thing aware one carryall get destroyed something else vehicle ready returned field vehicle eventually smash way repair centre destroying building necessary q amount spice mission limited  yes gone ca nt replaced thing steal enemy pretty hard great incentive go overboard building unnecessary building eg vehicle factory q building worth trying steal  vehicle factory produce house weapon sonic tank devastator deviator windtraps easier building spice silo instant money could bothered capture building inside enemy base try surround rocket turret hit enemy vehicle etc produced rocket turret however fire upon enemy building negative point capturing building soldier take forever get b soldier often get killed getting building c hard keep building red without destroying q aim death hand missile correctly  ca nt always hit aimed harkonnen would trouble winning every time level best bet pick middle enemy base way chance landing something q longer range sonic tank missile launcher  missile launcher ordos deviators longer range one square q ordos build missile launcher  ordos never build missile launcher may buy starport available capture enemy vehicle factory able use produce also q capture building  damage building  red  damage sector move infantry unit take damage red unit destroyed building damaged capture certain building trooper invade captured eg palace q ca nt build ground vehicle build carryall  due fact separate count total number carryall ornithopter owned everyone like building quota computer many shoot picking damaged vehicle q tell harvester refinery return  harvester generally return last refinery unloaded want go different one instruct move return one possible q score calculated  score nt depend time despite look like thing factor amount spice harvested number enemy unit destroyed number enemy building destroyed building taken nt count building destroyed maximise score take time end destroying last building harvest available spice even better let last building left refinery harvest spice destroying continual supply harvester computer get q make troop move group  simply pick unit leader aim rest group vehicle leader enemy destroyed move leader whatever destination rest vehicle follow aim tank tank aim tank tank move tank make game slower one thing beware x number vehicle following tank say leading tank destroyed rest group cease move happily sit often range enemy turret q use mcv  mcv allows build new construction yard simply move vehicle normal want new construction site double click mcv button hey presto new yard appear shown   ie mcv placed want top left cc hand corner new construction yard  cc   rock mcv c construction yard q self destruct devastator  simply double click devastator button start beep mcv beep explode destroy one unit well lying beside turret well red powerful self destruct explosion compared usual explosion killed enemy may enough destroy turret windtrap silo etc much useful playing ordos attacked devastators simply deviate self destruct q much spice harvester hold  unit spice q windtraps damage low power icon flashing found building damaged  short power building accumulate damage reach half damage likely rate damage depends short power factory especially seem vunerable q lose  credit building nothing  unsure correct answer hint manual might represent wear tear due exposure element though would expect represented slight damage building q much money get start mission  table starting credit house level atreides ordos harkonnen  q got vehicle dropped carryall nt know  nope got reinforcement arrive certain level dropped carryall usually beside base sometimes appear anywhere screen get nt vary time play level though vary level                                        strategy section faq divided three defence avoid getting wiped b offence wipe enemy c general thing aware strategy defence use harvester run approaching enemy troop get hit get tank use run troop much quicker shooting especially attacked sardukar fremen soon start new level use vehicle given explore direction find spice little  bump  sand often spice b approximate location enemy base done restart level start building nt explore far built good defence computer start work strategy  ca nt see ca nt see  soon build rocket turret build put line facing direction base square apart make sure  explored  least square greater radius turret allows turret get lock approaching vehicle soldier attack hit base build  heaviest direct combat vehicle ie tank set flat u missile launcher side ie lx xl x x x l launcher x tank important point left right  horn  far enough away centre attacked enemy vehicle arrive lx xl x x x wait enemy get past  horn  start attacked front tank move horn inward attack siderear using launcher distance let front line break keep vehicle backup move part line taking beating defend missile launcher well devastating distance easily destroyed close make sure leave unit rear building defend enemy unit dropped carryall keep eye radar see circular gap appear near spice field generally mean missile launcher rocket turret firing upon one harvester                                        b strategy offence destroy harvester get far base explode releasing however much spice harvested make sure destroy sand destroyed rock spice lost nt use soldier trooper attack harvester harvester turn run attacker time foot unit standing mountain range unit go mountain foot unit still attacked mountain run concentrate attack one structure time computer pumping money repairing attacking wo nt able keep pace unless concentrated attack attacking building use missile launcher attack rocket turret first moving tank behind launcher defend vehicle attack remember radius detection launcher one greater turret x x x x radius turret x x x x x x xx xx xxx xxx xxx l best position launcher nt get hit easy idiotproof way get launcher safe position                                 place launcher straight line far away turret ready attack lock couple tank onto missile launcher aim missile launcher distant turret launcher trundle forward within range turret range tank follow provide protection launcher turret use tank launcher destroy building remember computer rebuild turret place nt hang around move destroy quickly often useful leave couple strong vehicle square directly around turret rebuilt immediately attack remember unit close fired upon missile turret fire back normal gun much le damage added bonus turret nt rebuilt concrete take le hit destroy attacking enemy force use kamikaze unit scout base locate construction yard launch heavy attack construction yard construction site destroyed settle war attrition low level trike best scouting higher level use combat tank                                        c strategy general create repair facility soon lot cheaper faster repair vehicle rather build new one build one carryall harvester well  use transporting damaged unit nt bother building refinery much efficient build two along extra harvester two use carryall transportation build starport early way get palace watch vehicle price carefully lot fluctuation remember starport need payment sending vehicle must sufficient fund buy straight away unlike vehicle factory order multiple item short time level build two refinery silo increase cash expensive unit sand worm remain dormant unit computer come within couple square fired vehicle map rock sand worm stay still reduced half damage vehicle go sand sand worm disappear reduced half damage eaten unit hurry get rid one send trike towards lead towards enemy base fired let enemy vehicle get drawn onto sand let sand worm eat trike watch eat fleeing enemy choose region attack mission remember house controlling region palace whereas house nt ca nt order one vehicle one time spaceport spaceport replenish sold stock time though damaged building produce slower undamaged one much difference green production rate noticeably lower rocket turret also fire le often damaged damaged unit fire le frequently unit green fire half rate palace nt cost anything repair keep top condition time start scenario set unit guarding enemy construction centre destroyed nt replaced make sure take unit main offensive computer attack one front nt look weakness defensive belt therefore defend one front need leave unit guard back enemy unit dropped carryall reported square contained building destroyed saboteur ca nt rebuilt quite time nt know never even managed destroy building saboteur computer rebuilds building placed unit destroying nt leave unit something like vehicle factory without making sure already destroyed enemy construction site note computer rebuilds build something different computer build building unconnected construction site problem unless dislike computer game cheating aware may attacking dummy base construction site nt damage base get rebuilt wasted time effort scout around first                                        house strategy atreides q fremen best used  send fremen often possible overwhelm enemy sheer number useful mapping enemy base ca nt control movement make mapping somewhat erratic try aim area intend attack later way vehicle guarding area may destroyed another way use fremen later game shock troop simply add heavy offensive keep going end game sit back tear base bit hand q sonic tank best used  effective foot unit destroy two hit also useful rocket turret close range best used defence destroying undefended building q atreides unit wo nt fire worm without ordered else guard worm  really either order vehicle attack sonic tank best wait worm eat harvester beginning level lose last harvester get free replacement build one refinery wait worm get three free meal                                        b house strategy ordos q deviators best used  deviator best weapon use indirect offensive purpose best time close opposing force building aim deviator strongest vehicle find get attack structure defence enemy wo nt recognise enemy let destroy structure destroyed structure allegiance revert easily redeviated problem come use attack vehicle return fire vehicle revert original allegiance also effective defending devastators deviate destruct deviated unit selected reverts able give one last order allegiance set enemy allows attack building without attacked beware fact deviators significantly shorter range missile launcher q raider trike best used  important thing keep moving due speed outrun anything missile launcher pretty useless get close used map enemy base speed keep trouble offensive weapon nt much good unless continually moving q saboteur good  general nope terrible compared death hand fremen highly unlikely break strong defense destroy building even turret however destroy vehicle may hampering advance seems happen building apparently absorbed saboteur without damage hit taken damage usual ie throw saboteur turret attack turret destroyed much quickly usual rumour perhaps building destroyed saboteur harder rebuild hard check see house paramount importance ordos build starport buy missile launcher destroying rocket turret bit tricky otherwise though always try attack massed seige tank selected turret  bit frantic effective early game house siege tank nt must split attacking siege tank attack  combat tank                                        c house strategy harkonnen q devastators best used  group formidable offensive defensive force make sure repair centre surrounded wall well couple carryall way attack damage get repaired start attacking one destroyed better destruct let explode damage selfdestruct using spearhead attack base suffer rocket turret using target practice due slow speed best pick section base leading straight construction yard group vehicle along front weaken turret missile launcher throw devastators forward one turret intention punching hole defence taking yard inside missile range firepower  well devastating q death hand missile best used  launch target group
