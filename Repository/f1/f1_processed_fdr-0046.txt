early mit become standard feature many operating system ftp probably convenient way send file internet also easy detect location ftp site reason many site active day two brought operator escape detection basic ftp simple server computer chosen ftp server software set point anyone internet address computer user information needed log system access file server machine  storage address user information distributed person internet via world wide web irc usenet newsgroups using ftp simple many wellwritten ftp client program let user get put file using ftp internet protocol pirate also come ftp client called  warezftp  special feature certain pirate might want use example warezftp detect display name hidden directory often created ftp site using program like warezftp know directory exists pirate able enter trade file motive behind putting ftp site risky enterprise since internet service provider usually notify spa sometimes even fbi suspect illegal activity commercial gain fact pirate lose money paying excessive internet connection fee sometimes pirate may spend even money paying hacker cracking job hacker remove copyright protection might embedded software usually cracking done free occasion pirate desire speed accuracy cracker paid large sum reason pirate put ftp site distribute software hope getting something return pirate spread popularity piracy group might member monitoring activity ftp site harder bulletin board system whereas bb one usually see list last user one usually full list member always easy get touch someone recently logged system ftp site almost identification anywhere except ftp log file usually stored server computer ftp log contains internet address logins  usenet another method user group sharing newsgroups newsgroups internet usenet result early attempt create threadbased virtual conversation medium unlike bulletin board system user post message specialized  forum  however unlike bb usenet network consisting many server post made one server sent across whole usenet network hope get everywhere  different newsgroups topic ranging fan bill gate technical discussion relating operation blender internet newsgroups distinguished specialized naming structure example newsgroup concern humorous post called rechumor rec stand recreation newsgroups pornographic material start altbinariespictureserotica alt short alternative computer newsgroup announcing new product microsoft window may called composmswindowsannounce comp short computer surprisingly also newsgroups pirate frequent called altbinarieswarez altwarezibmpc piracy newsgroups option many considered tried due technical problem noticeable structure usenet impractical pirate locate service post message including data information could illegally obtained piece software without specifying poster  name technical problem surface post first occurs due nature usenet message encoded special way compatible old usenet server scheme actually expands size posted file also posted file big split several part often case part necessarily replicated server example someone may post megabyte software package usenet due encoding part size turn part make server since part needed reassemble program posting useless due relatively low volume file transferred usenet even minor focus software company  recent effort curtail piracy  email email far popular feature internet also first method invented internet communication recent standard multimedia internet mail extension mime indirectly aided spread emailbased piracy permitting email software correctly encode file transmission global network using email user may  attach  file email message addressee  email inbox allow large message pirate trade huge file using relatively private method fortunately people  inboxes set maximum size megabyte barely enough even smallest commercial application program thus email major method pirate file exchange www world wide web www extremely popular internet communication medium one recent advance internet technology invented scientist cern physic laboratory switzerland world wide web oneway tvlike medium content provider may post information desire beginning world wide web pirate uncomfortable posting file collection public way anyone internet may access publicly posted information virtually way restrict investigation proper authority lately however web grew size became le manageable pirate putting information online longer feel threatened way take information persuade internet service provider isp shut pirate  service since isps realize cutting someone  service viewed internet censor usually lead loss customer reluctant block anyone  service commercial piracy method involve active pirating population profitable distribution stolen software defines another side market larger scale market involves sale illegally duplicated software large quantity largescale pirate work profit involved redistribution illegal software two major component large scale piracy software rental compact disk manufacturing always illegal rent unauthorized copy software legal rent original version loss revenue associated rental prompted u congress pas computer software rental amendment act act make possible software publisher explicitly prohibit rental license agreement interestingly exception law created specifically nonprofit library could rent original software without express permission publisher  cdr second major component large scale piracy duplication computer compact disk advent software distribution via compact disk offered developer level protection unavailable conventional floppy disk ability duplicate disk limited expense cdr  compact disk writer however advance technology price cd copier come considerably current cdr  purchased around dollar lead considerable growth availability pirated software cd  large volume storage available cd also previously limited copying potential pirate limitation longer issue ability copy directly another cd production counterfeit cd  become considerable part illegal pirating software distribution counterfeit cd  take two form cd  explicitly marked illegal copy cleverly disguised original former common form distribution explicit marking simply disguise purchaser generally aware illegal nature product however duplicate packaging stolen software ability user distinguish legitimate becomes difficult volume pirated software also grown advent cd copying large available storage one cd numerous program copied stored single disk significantly eased difficulty distributing stolen program growth cd duplication evidenced influx counterfeit cd software foreign market copy distributed rapidly efficiently large market summary production cd software become significant component pirating industry copyprotection light many effective method software piracy protection software program become increasingly difficult battle protect software industry neverending struggle pirate continually find new way illegally copy distribute software software piracy prevalent software developer protect intellectual property software industry invested serious amount time development new form protection alongside industry many antipiracy organization campaign arisen combat flood illegal software first important component software protection engineered industry explore approach taken past approach currently used method software developer used fight growing problem look depth approach see success cost  hardware protection let u first start hardware solution software piracy issue best known method dongle dongle hardware  key  allow application run pc server hardware  key  must purchased separately application therefore software developer configure software require dongle extremely successful approach however great cost cost approximately per dongle mean application cost double fact made solution limited used almost highend application cost dongle real approach employed software developer us hardware help fight piracy  software protection common approach fighting software piracy software among approach used serial number cdkeys encryption manual reference registration requirement installation restriction take look depth serial use serial number requires user enter serial number install application many application use method including prominent title fauve matisse janna contact abode photoshop etc installing one application required enter serial number usually found software manual successfully complete installation idea behind requires user software also manual however approach easily defeated many popular software title serial number available world wide web limit effectiveness serial number another problem serial number serial number cracker cracker application designed find necessary serial number get past serial number check cdkeys microsoft offer similar strategy software title called cdkey  serial number  located back cd case tendigit number required complete installation microsoft software product serial number way defeat check first cdkeys us scheme xxxxxxxxxx person find scheme used create cdkey use microsoft product another technique specialized form serial number check called certificate authenticity coa way endusers assured oem original equipment manufacturer authentic coa digit alphanumeric number must entered enduser use microsoft operating system came oem computer large range possible combination difficulty relatively high cracking serial number manual check manual reference another approach software developer employ fight software piracy used mainly game every time game launched code usually form unique word required game played prime example game stunt brøderbund every time launch game specifies page paragraph word enter manual idea must manual play game get copy game start playing method two major drawback first hassle paying customer go every time want play game second way around manual reference could photocopy manual write unique word keep launching game one show registration different approach software piracy protection force registration various way registration might require payment case simply registering name address etc software developer use method encryption protect software lock software  software key  software work user get  key  software developer software developer force user register release key using approach developer create unique key every user developer like idea forcing registration instead shipped software key application second method effective first approach distinct use application distributed via electronic online distribution software developer force registration creating limit use application prior registration example limiting number launch registration approach used primarily shareware freeware demo example approach employed quicken se intuit another common approach instead number launch limit number day application run registration required used particularly shareware freeware demo example netscape navigator beta application limit use application day register application limit removed limiting installation radical attempt new method microsoft proposed limiting number installation office total technique soon abandoned many people complained microsoft obviously public relation priority piracy concern certificate previous approach way protect software pirated purchased manufacturer like microsoft gone step microsoft decided fight software piracy retail store placed certificate authenticity coa side box coa contains hidden nonreproducible watermark making nearly impossible pirate copy box therefore user see box without coa safe assume pirated version microsoft software antipiracy
