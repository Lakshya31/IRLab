proposed scheme reviewed phil karn bdale garbee verbally mike chepponis encouraged used phil code currently support subnetwork aspect scheme future real reason national coordination address actual network least geographically coordinated group experimenter formed offered issue keep track subnet address  owner  presumably responsible network implementors manager basic premise behind proposed plan amateur radio network politically defined plan based upon presumption current voice network serve proper analog predict general characteristic yet unconstructed digital network political entity build network funded controlled maintained used primarily member guest separately managed network viewed subnetwork amprnet idea somehow rationally partition xxxxxxxxx amprnet address space subnetwork within amprnet maintain routing table constituent provide host tacs gateway ie mechanism user simple terminal ax level box access network resource switch rule network administration security measure quite possibly link level protocol natural limitation span control probably limit service area network another factor leading partitioning amprnet address space respect separate subnetworks partitioning address space allow much simplified routing table host internetworking gateway connect independently controlled subnetworks gateway maintain routing table local host gateway network host relay switch given subnet need maintain routing information regarding member subnet gateway network required routing table prove manageable make kind geographically based hueristic addressing scheme zip code area code etc moot would also like propose coordinate logical network name corresponding address based political network subdivision concept naming convention map directly ip address purely convenience network developer considered necessary however good reasoning behind making network host name hierarchical meaningful end user considerably aid bootstrapping initial network comprehensible nonnetwork folk primary user network naming convention proposed form userid hostsubnet amprnetres westnet sbarcnet santa barbara arc gfrnnet represent three hypothetical network writer could involved perhaps provider gateway andor host service subnetwork entity could distinct address perhaps several internally administered hostuser address note throughout paper host hostuser represents host user running ip protocol direct network access also purpose following example wajpr network address rather represents userid local host writer opinion majority packet user forseeable future using simple tncs connected host via ax level protocol wajpr may  user  host one network station washington dc logged onto amprnet host may send internet traffic successfully wajpr jprhostwestnet traffic would routed westnet via various amprnet gateway subnetwork level relay santa barbara host known internally westnet reachable via wamt switch traffic could also directed wally sbarc presuming santa barbara amateur radio club maintains message server host gatewayed amprnet catenet based upon presumption amprnetsubnethost hierarchy would seem could easily decide allocate xxxxxxxxx bit ip address field bit allocated sufficient number individually managed subnetworks leaving correspondingly adequate number assignable bit internal addressing need individual subnetwork accordingly following proposed initial addressing scheme methodology address assignment bit numbering per rfc pg bit usa station nonusa station note meant imply geographic basis assignment meant provide quick mean segregating fcc controlled participant nonfcc station bit represent politically separate subnetworks within amprnet bit assigned inverse binary sequence see example beginning significant bit first bit unassigned reserved future allocation network address network administration internally assigned host andor user address combination completely new intermediate class address bit used within politically separate amprnet subnetworks individual host switch workstation etc determined local network administration would recommended bit assigned binary sequence least significant bit assigned first resulting network address would follows amprnet   subnet     host           address assignable        address reserved              address assignable        address reserved              address assignable

network subnet intranet hostuser address begin immediately assigned experimenter retaining largest possible contiguous block unassigned bit whose assignment defined future little impact previously allocated address user hostname subnetadministration naming scheme represents humanfriendly network naming convention map easily numerical network address believe approach general conformance requirement rfc  internet standard subnetting procedure  numbering scheme initially proposed allows amprnet subnetworks host usa retaining five bit future expansion  individual amprnet addressable entity proposed method address assignment followed run hostuser address run network address simply pick least significant reserved bit assign hostuser address conversely network address popular could easily expand taking significant reserved bit allocating network addressing become clear every user network need ip address network could allocate user block user increment least significant reserved bit possible combination network individually addressable unit network hostsusers  individually addressable entity writer presumes million plus address ought last u amateur population time come need
