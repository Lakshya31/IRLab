energy extracted distant target also beam  scanned  open receiver timewise side side top bottom scanning yet another single beam intersection zone phasing pulse even better representation obtained thus receiver produce representation energy extracted various location within distant endothermic zone displaying received signal appropriately scanned screen representation distant scene created special kind  microwave interferometry   modern technique  imagery obtained surprisingly good development might even become good image presently obtained side looking acquisition radar interestingly enough since scalar beam easily penetrate earth ocean one also look beneath earth ocean type scanning scalar interferometer importance capability strategic tactical reconnaissance obvious camouflage
