make alcohol   guy six foot present part getting homemade high file       l c h l        first must obtain steal holding tank recommend gallon alhambra water jug often left porch driveway refill take porch  run home put going put still need kept together hide still even nt parent shit see illegal federal law could get busted pretty well make still collapsible fit small box hide box room going use still take hide behind bush passing state trooper snoopy neighbor phed busting pirated game wo nt see keep alhambra jug still going cause way big hide anywhere also keep still somewhere good breeze away people smell fermenting shit smell like puke even worse distilling heater might put smoke alcohol smell like alcohol heated mash smell worse shit go buy shitload fresh frozen whatever check list frozen corn easiest deal already cut cob forgiving beginner besides part great american tradition moonshine                          ingredient product                          rye potato vodka molasses sugar cane rum corn moonshine wheat rye whiskey barley rice beer grape wine apple juice hard cider sake rice                          put bag corn jug carbon dioxide released sometime push could get shit ground waste besides start rot ground smell even worse anyway add enough lukewarm water cover surface leave stuff exposed air week room temperature day bubble look smell like puke problem sure got adequate ventilation installing small fan alhambra jug problem drilling hole side plastic sharp drill bit easy drill two hole near top wo nt corn fan tend heat short circuit exposed water insert two tube make fan blowing air jug mist mash wear still complicated bear u first take big beaker something like put big tube going top glue around tube none gas escape run smaller tube side bigger tube connect valve connect side valve huge thing fermented whatever make sure tube connects bottom go straight across pressure water push along pipe pump get messy mount alhambra jug brick whole thing look like fermented   shit        valve     brick    beaker   bend big pipe around pointing degree angle connect bigger pipe condenser connect small pipe leading condenser big cup something catch proof alcohol also make rack put beaker put sterno bunsen burner would recommend putting thermometer inside beaker leave temperature boiling point alcohol nt wo nt get strong alcohol   fermented    shit        cond valve  enser    brick    beaker             pipe        alcohol  sterno  everything little farther apart depicted picture wanted use column column inch margin however longer tube leading away beaker condenser longer distillation process take keep quite close get alcohol close flame might evaporate keep end long pipe one last step take long length surgical tubing stuff make water weenie wrap around condenser leaving almost space coil usually wrap duct tape around tubing keep place insulates bit run one end tubing mom flower garden end valve connect end valve hose cold water source nt anything stupid like use liquid nitrogen instead water cause wo nt speed distilling process finished still look like    fermented       heated shit    water        valve      cold     valve water brick     beaker             pipe        alcohol  sterno  friend mine going lot distilling cause made huge still going first class lived near creek stayed pretty cool going figure use unlimited supply water creek grew plenty bush hid still even painted valve green stuck bush glued leaf nobody could tell still still nt water could nt small electric pump cause nt electricity turn length surgical tubing going water around superhuge condenser made rock concrete dam  foot high get fast stream suction ran tube dam sucked siphon water creek condenser back creek still awesome thing run much want cause isnt wasting water wo nt show water bill going distilling lot stuff better make tube going bottom beaker dump water garbage every course connect valve wo nt loose precious alcohol trying turn steam beaker make sure tube like one nt made glass melt bad tube melt cause mean rebuild still almost scratch got set corn whatever fermented hooked beaker turn valve bit drip puke alhambra jug beaker turn sterno bunsen burner high flame heat beaker turn coldwater valve cold water flowing around condenser trickle water coming condenser cold turn valve even le water coming nt want use much water warm job keep water coming lukewarm thing starting keep good eye thermometer want keep temperature boiling point alcohol le boiling point water degree separate water alcohol turning alcohol steam get better stuff sure boiling point alcohol ask science teacher look cause nt know either watch adjust valve fermented stuff coming alhambra jug equal steam going pipe wo nt fill boil dry adjust cold water valve water coming surgical tubing slightly warm wait read book download another six foot production always keep eye still alhambra jug empty beaker dry done nt expect go quick however like almost pure alcohol distill right could water inside liquid high however even nt able get batch good take practice getting know still different personality around proof ethyl alcohol collecting cup pour alcohol activated charcoal remove nasty shit make retarded blind stuff safe drink nt one swig proof alcohol probably kill proof experienced drinker derelict highest proof ever must worst experience life mix part alcohol part koolaid distilled water something koolaid water le proofage give idea beer around proof wine cooler around wine around would nt recommend proof first time make sure little bit alcohol shitload koolaid probably wo nt notice taste overdose way go wrong keep trying usually first time stuff taste like shit almost water take practice also proof roughly percentage time alcohol proof alcohol way high drink never go percent alcohol part alcohol part something else proof shit could kill coming soon part ii homemade high smoke pot see ya
