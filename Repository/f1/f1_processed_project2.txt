conscious level approach best mind first practice disassociating second physical body limited time action follows designed basically familiarization orientation technique permit approach disassociation without fear concern release extremity serf acquaint sensation second body without full commitment relaxation creation vibration state work either right left hand arm one time important first affirmation reality second one hand reach object floor wall door whatever remember beyond reach physical arm reach object make reaching process neither upward downward direction arm pointing reach stretching arm raising lowering variation simply reach hand arm manner special object mind often method better preconceived idea  feel  reach fashion feel nothing push hand little farther keep pushing gently stretching arm hand encounter material object vibration pattern effect work hand eventually feel touch something examine sense touch physical detail object feel crack groove unusual detail later able identify point nothing seem unusual sensory mechanism tell touching object physical hand first test acquainting object outstretched hand straighten hand push object fingertip encounter resistance first push little harder gently overcome resistance feel point hand seem go right object keep pushing hand completely object meet physical object identify second object touch carefully withdraw hand back first object slowly back normal feel  belongs  decrease vibration best way slowly attempt move physical body think physical body open physical eye bring back physical sens deliberately vibration faded away completely lie still minute full complete return get make notation object  felt  locating relative position hand arm lying note detail first second object felt done compare description actual first object make special note small detail could seen distance physically feel object compare felt vibration examine second object manner may consciously aware presence position prior experiment important test line direction place physical hand lay first object second straight line check result first object touched physically located distance would absolutely impossible reach without physical movement detail object especially minute detail coincide note made make comparison second object answer affirmative first success fact check try another day almost without qualification produced vibrational state perform exercise also practice following quite easily producing vibrational state lying back arm either side chest gently lift arm without looking touch finger together quite casually abstractly remember sensory result clasped hand chest look first closed eye moved easily enough see physical nonphysical arm physical arm rest side upon chest sensory impression nonphysical arm hand physical body test phenomenon many time wish however desire prove moving physical arm something else whatever mean necessary give full assurance reality important always return nonphysical arm full conjunction physical counterpart  shutting  vibration state although may severe aftereffect done think best find early stage disassociation technique simplest method use separating physical  liftout  procedure intent travel faroff place get acquainted sensation room familiar surroundings reason first true experience examined explored identifiable point reference order assist orientation better first complete disassociation exercise conducted daylight test need regard amount light room avoid using electric light possible establish condition achieve vibrational state maintain complete control thought process going stay confines familiar room think getting lighter floating upward nice would float upward sure think nice would subjective associated thought important want something respond emotionally react even act anticipation continue hold thought disassociate float gently upward physical may achieve first time second quite surely achieved preceding exercise achieve second method  rotation  technique mentioned elsewhere prescribed condition slowly try turn turning bed comfortable make attempt help rotate either arm leg start turning twisting top body head shoulder first mean move slowly exerting gently firm pressure may become loose actually spin like log rolling water alter pressure action disconcerting may lose orientation forced find way back carefully rotation juncture ease begin turn friction sense weight inform begun succeed disassociating happens turn slowly feel moved degree ie face face physical body uncanny recognize position degree face merely two degree turn without orientation easy sense degree position stop rotation merely thinking without hesitation think floating upward backing away physical body reached vibrational state successfully method surely bring result two separation technique first tried second examined tested one seems easiest utilized local experiment familiarization succeeded separation process important objective continuity remain complete control possible way seems staying close physical early stage whatever may feel emotionally keep close proximity physical admonition made known danger maintain stepbystep familiarity thus perceive exactly taking place wild uncontrolled trip stage may well produce uncomfortable situation condition force relearn much already achieved process mental acclamation different ever consciously experienced gradual adaptation greatly enhance peace mind confidence point principal exercise return keep separation distance three foot away hovering physical make attempt time move laterally farther   know far aware something sense vision zero conditioned open eye let remain closed moment stay close physical mental concept keep proper range next three four exercise nothing practice getting   returning physical return condition merely  think  back physical return used first method separation reintegration relatively simple back exact alignment able move portion physical body reactivate physical sens time return open physical eye physically sit know completely  back together  ensure orientation instill confidence return important assure continued contact material world belong whatever believe reassurance necessary applied rotation method move slowly back toward physical thinking feel made complete contact start rotation back degree conjunction physical seems make difference whether continue circle rotation reverse turn back motion opposite helped release technique seems slight clicklike jerk conjunction physical exact description sensation quite difficult recognize always wait moment sitting returned primarily avoid possible uneasiness give time readjust physical environment physical act sitting provides evidence continuity demonstrable form know consciously willfully act physical movement interspersed experiment nonphysical environment retain conscious awareness throughout process completed cycle able separate return physical sit note time go back separation process return physical second time without loss conscious continuity notation clock reading help next step familiarization separate slightly farther distance applying procedure distance ten foot always keep mental concentration single purpose without stray though pattern especially extended exercise become accustomed feeling  apart  mentally tell see think act opening eye may well transmit physical diminish vibrational state instead think seeing see see sensation eye opening blackness disappear suddenly first seeing may dim halflight indistinct myopic known present use vision become sharp first sight physical body lying unnerving applied previous exercise satisfied   lying visually examine room perspective position mentally move slightly one direction another slowly never violently move arm leg reassure mobility roll around cavort new element wish always staying within prescribed range
