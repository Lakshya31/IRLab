chlorate perchlorate explosive dennis fritsinger  revised   warning  following material presented interest technical enlightenment information time writing accurate author knowledge material result year experience many hour careful experimenting manufacture transportation detona tion explosive may violation state federal local law preparation handling potentially unstable explo sive compound nature dangerous activity mishap could result injury death author held liable use misuse information bottom line always exercise caution preparing utilizing explosive composition flash composition chlorateperchlorate flashpowder described prepared manipulated moderate caution one safest explosive dealt preferred choice variety application requiring flammable powder explosive salute aerial display requiring loud report etc explosive quite effective detonated moderate large quantity initiated directly ignition brisance much greater conventional blackpowdertype explo sif confined oxidizer chloratesperchlorates used stable perchlorate group active harder get ammonium perchlorate least active seems sodium perchlor ate potassium perchlorate far commonly available although couple occasion supplier substituted chlorate much chagrin performs well chlorate relative perchlorate intrinsically stable le reactive general perchlorate much safer contact combustible substance relatively safe use sul fursulfide compound problem chlorate sulfur compound come fact sulfursulfides react chlorate form chloric acid rather unstable explo sive b flammable solid one important component flashpowder fuel reaction important fuel burn rapidly explosive force derived rapid expansion gas oxidizingburning fuel confined best fuel suited purpose light combustible metal two best metal used magnesium aluminum finely divided magnesium mesh finer fastest burning expensive pyro german black grade mesh almost fast third price per pound c composition preparation beauty basic chlorateperchlorate flashpowder simplicity two component blend together relatively safe procedure providing care taken eliminate anything produce spark using plastic glass container utensil recommended try avoid kind scraping fricative activity mixing manipulating ingredient also important tip keep mind prepare flashpowder far away flame heat source take step eliminate dust accumulation period excessive dust buildup probably major cause sudden explosion commercial clandestine firework factory slightly humid atmosphere ideal reducing combustible dust air making preparing pyrotechnic safer found small room humidifier effective purpose chloratesperchlorates hydroscopic nature usually rather chunky need reduced mortarpestle found grinding chunk adding small amount aluminum mixing keep chlorate clumping retain flourlike consistency ideal found experimentation ratio seven part oxidizer three part fuel work efficiently keep mind measuring solid chemical proportion weight volume get good lab scale using measuring cup wo nt get job done commercial pyrotechnic using chlorate flashpowder use basic aluminum chlorate combination work well improvement made addition compound change oxidation burning rate composition replacing one three part aluminum magnesium give brighter flash louder report also addition small amount antimony sulfide per cent eg gram chlorate use gram antimony sulfide speed reaction order magnitude careful antimony sulfide added unstable composition becomes use much compo sition explode without initiation adding finely powdered polyvinyl chloride cellulose based plastic add smoke explosion slows burning rate useful variety application requiring smoke detonation signaling special effect etc general rule preparing following compo sitions make small amount time never keep small amount hand reasoning reduce chance accidental ignition causing chain reaction type explosion accidental detonation large amount flash composition reduce average suburban house splin ters matter
