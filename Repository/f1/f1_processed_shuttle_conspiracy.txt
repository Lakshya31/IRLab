familiar hallmark american manned flight space early day beginning  project mercury  voice col john shorty power later  apollo  program voice regardless familiar voice  mission control  would always stay u throughout space flight  time time voice mission control moment launch nasa spokesman hugh harris last word harris spoke voice mission control word heard  shuttle cleared tower  television camera followed shuttle climbed higher higher column steam smoke another second allowed hear slowly fading roar shuttle rocket engine sound mission control abruptly changed exactly second liftoff  live  audio mission control terminated place nasa began feeding radio television network elaborate tape recording prepared far ahead time nasa changeover  live  audio nasa tape recording sounded like first loud roaring second abruptly fading steadily increasinginloudness hummingroaring second      roger  roaring sound second liftoff falsified nasa coverage flight  columbia  began still able see columbia way longdistance television camera another minute half sound hearing longer  live  sound special nasa tape recording first minute tape recording heard nothing sound effect simulating conversation shuttle nasahouston first time heard anonymous new voice mission control longer familiar live voice hugh harris recorded voice someone else added realism new voice interrupted turn recorded voice alleged capsule communicator daniel brandenstein sounded like first highpitched screech followed  one minute second coming gogogo   columbia negative seat   callup say columbia altitude high ejection seat use  point shuttle columbia mile high climbing fast everything going according plan far thing hearing tape recording corresponded seeing could still see shuttle tv set dwindled nothing three bright spot dancing distant sky last thing able see verify shuttle separation two giant solidrocket booster little two minute liftoff able watch booster two burning bright spot break side left single tiny flame shuttle gradually fading invisibility several second later nasa tape recording caught already seen said booster separated moment later tiny bright dot shuttle faded screen far away television camera follow longer last look real space shuttle columbia audio letter two month ago gave advance alert secret military mission space shuttle columbia time made public mission really also able reveal expect falsified nasa coverage mission falsified coverage designed accomplish two purpose first completely hide military nature mission second make sure mission looked like total success matter might happen secret detailed audio letter bolshevik federal government depending heavily space shuttle program get ready nuclear war russia falsified nasa coverage mission space shuttle columbia carried exactly according plan revealed plan two month ago standard brief cockpit scene made technique describe later make look good spiced telling u noncritical tile fallen otherwise told perfectly columbia performing four day ago april news conference flight held houston texas alleged two astronaut john young robert crippen entity called john young summed flight word meaningful people suspected referring falsified flight followed television called quote   even better normal  friend bolshevik control nasa bent backwards paint image abnormally perfect shuttle flight meanwhile actual shuttle mission carried secret go according plan shuttle disappeared television screen flight continued barely four minute disaster struck columbia never even reached earth orbit friend believe right need know happened space shuttle columbia two week ago believe deserve know detail truth hidden stake involve nothing le survival land way life three special topic audio letter topic  advance preparation space shuttle mission topic  aborted flight space shuttle  columbia  topic  nasa coverup  columbia  disaster topic  old saying  seeing believing  reason television become tool deception america today television made see thing understand believe thing true television used honestly constructively television could great force good instead used continually hoax deceive mislead u videotaping make event took place week month ago look taking place  live  right eye computer editing enables scene spliced together create completely artificial image look real special effect kind enable television hoax convincing indeed two year ago described one major television hoax detail audio letter hoax involved le nbc television news program  meet press  treated another great television hoax one granddaddy term sheer deception  meet press  hoax  guyana  skylab rolled one hoax coverage first flight space shuttle columbia begin led believe two week ago space shuttle ever left earth atmosphere gone space also led believe first space flight shuttle orbital flight instead something le extreme make matter still worse nasa swore first flight pushing shuttle limit men aboard one point even john young quoted effect widely controlled major medium example two month ago february new york time carried big article shuttle quoting article  mr young said conducted unmanned orbital flight shuttle first would added perhaps  project cost meant another year delay  statement like cooked purely explain away many thing add announced plan columbia flight many people believe explanation litany lie example time time television coverage alleged flight month john young earlier statement totally contradicted authoritative spokesman pointed astronaut control shuttle telling computer aboard shuttle want computer actual activation control shuttle  emergency shuttle fly orbit reenter even land without help pilot much lie nasa told u unmanned first flight impossible real reason astronaut aboard first orbital flight one revealed audio letter military mission astronaut aboard carry nasa told u flight month test flight cargo bay practically empty cargo bay columbia empty carried laserarmed spy satellite equipped special shield protect russian space weapon  wait minute  say  showed u live picture space could see bay empty  friend  live  picture video tape picture door closed taken inside training mockup shuttle carried inside specially modified boeing picture door open taken ground inside darkened hangar scene combined video tape editing technique video tape earth taken

bay shadow space tend sharp harsh air soften diffuse shadow saw video tape television softer made space also look angle shadow earth shown floating straight overhead daylight look slant shadow inside open cargo bay ask  light coming make shadow like  impossible shadow saw shuttle bay video tape one small example many discrepancy nasa hoax point nasa pretended columbia flight month first shuttle flight space supposed believe previous shuttle operation gliding test launched mid air another modified nothing could ridiculous untrue one obvious question space shuttle program nasa always managed side step somehow one ever quite dare ask question nt space shuttle  enterprise  first sent orbit enterprise made public debut nearly four year ago summer outward appearance enterprise look almost identical sister ship columbia difference two subtle would never notice unless knew exactly look engine enterprise look like engine columbia enterprise also covered system thermal tile columbia question nt enterprise sent orbit long ago nasa wait three year launch columbia instead answer friend enterprise designed training ship shuttle astronaut meant orbital flight instead specially equipped make shorter suborbital flight space effect everything short going earth orbit climb orbital altitude high mile dropping back earth enables astronaut practice working weightlessness five onehalf minute time also allows astronaut practice landing shuttle slowing speed around  mile per hour enterprise exactly like sister ship crew compartment cockpit make enterprise radically different cargo bay area enterprise carry cargo bay area taken rocket fuel tank tank enterprise hold well  pound rocket fuel fully loaded make suborbital hop space enterprise perched top modified boeing known
