isolate earth able even point coolest place sun centre sunspot alone temperature seems fallen sufficiently low allow chemical compound form thus able determine star comet nebulæ made unique discovery sir norman lockyer detected light coming prominence sun given substance known earth attributed unknown gas called helium greek helios sun sir william ramsay discovered certain mineral gas identified spectroscope say therefore gas discovered sun nearly thirty year found earth discovery longlost heir thrilling chapter detective story science sensational story day make u feel quite certain method really tell u element sun star built light corona sun mentioned indicates gas still unknown earth christened coronium measuring speed light soon new use found spectroscope found could measure difficult speed measure speed line sight movement right angle direction one looking sufficient easy detect distance moving body known easy measure movement line vision difficult detect difficult measure yet even enormous distance astronomer deal spectroscope detect movement furnish data measurement luminous body containing say sodium moving rapidly towards spectroscope found sodium line spectrum moved slightly usual definite position towards violet end spectrum amount change position increasing speed luminous body body moving away spectroscope shifting spectral line opposite direction towards red end spectrum way discovered measured movement otherwise would probably revealed unmistakably u thousand year way watched measured speed tremendous movement sun gained proof vast disturbance expect actually occur illustration spectroscope instrument analysing light provides mean identifying different substance pictorial diagram illustrates principal spectrum analysis showing sunlight decomposed primary colour call white light composed seven different colour diagram relieved detail would unduly obscure simple process ray light broken prism different wavelength spectrum ray greatly magnified sun dying  let u return consideration sun u earth patent astonishing fact sun tremendous energy heat light amazing quantity pour without ceasing energy come enormous jet red glowing gas seen shooting outwards sun like flame fire thousand mile argue fire know fire earth point scientist sure sun burning combustion source heat combustion chemical reaction atom condition make possible known result predictable measurable chemical reaction nature combustion know explain sun energy indeed ordinary chemical reaction kind sun composed combustible material throughout condition combustion understand always present sun would burn thousand year marked change heat light production process advanced evidence change instead strong evidence sun emitting light heat prodigious quantity thousand million year every addition knowledge throw light sun age seems make increase rather decrease year make wonder energy greater avoid issue source energy saying merely sun gradually radiating away energy originated unknown manner away back beginning thing reliable calculation show year required mere cooling globe like sun could possibly run million word sun energy must subject continuous le steady renewal however may acquired enormous energy past must source energy present best explanation today continuous accretion energy due shrinkage sun bulk force gravity gravity one mysterious force nature obvious fact body behave attracted one another newton worked law attraction may say without trying go deeply thing every particle matter attracts every throughout universe diameter sun shrink one mile round would mean million ton outer onemile thickness would straight drop one mile towards centre obviously layer outer mile would also drop inwards le degree one tremendous movement matter however slowly might take place tremendous energy would involved astronomer calculate shrinkage one mile round would require fifty year completion assuming reasonably close continuous relationship loss heat radiation shrinkage even true need feel overanxious theory sun became cold support life many million year would required suggested one time fall meteoric matter sun would account sun heat position hardly tenable mere bulk meteoric matter required hypothesis apart reason undoubtedly enormous amount meteoric matter moving within bound solar system seems following definite route round sun like planet stray erratic quantity destined meet doom collision sun hardly sufficient account sun heat recent study radioactive body suggested another factor may working powerfully along force gravitation maintain sun store heat radioactive body certain atom seem undergoing disintegration atom appear splitting minute primitive constituent since matter may split constituent may built question whether  radioactive  element undergoing disintegration formation sun undergoing disintegration  sun undoubtedly radioactive  another source heat sun last indefinitely
