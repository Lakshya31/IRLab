united state air force ufology year debate debunkers skeptic opposed believer raged whether united state government specifically united state air force considers subject ufology serious business also must considered element department government would concerned ufo proved threat united state airforce maintained thirty year largest percentage report explainable usally however air force also maintains rest could explained enough information present true smoke screen many researcher maintain anything air force tell officer corp may presented enigma course duty following document taken

unidentified flying object ufo well according united state air force regulation  dated september ufo   aerial phenomenon object unknown appears ordinary observer  broad definition applies equally well one individual seeing first noctilucent cloud twilight another individual seeing first helicopter however present people consider term ufo mean object behaves strange erratic manner moving earth atmosphere strange phenomenon evoked strong emotion great curiosity among large segment world population average person interested love mystery professional military man involved possible threat national security scientist interested basic curiosity led becoming researcher literature ufo vast story many varied present sketchy outline subject chapter outline includes description classification

description leaf ancient report open considerable misinterpretation may well present evaluation individual report completely wrong nevertheless let u start intriguing story one oldest chronicle india book dzyan book group  storyteller  legend finally gathered manuscript form man learned write one story small group being supposedly came earth many thousand year ago metal craft orbited earth several

within second stopped fort drifted slowly downward large big aircraft surrounded strong orange glow distinct humming sound heard heat struck sentry collapsed almost immediately managed slide shelter heavy cannon loud cry awoke garrison troop scrambling towards battle station complete electrical failure occurred panic light came back number men still managed see orange glow leaving area high speed sentry found badly burned  one unconscious incoherent suffering deep shock thus ufo sighting appear extend back  year time also global nature one feeling phenomenon deserves sort valid scientific investigation even low level effort  theory nature ufo phenomenon cohesive theory nature ufo theory advanced collected five group mysticism b hoax ranting due unstable personality c secret weapon natural phenomenon e alien visitor mysticism believed cult mission ufo crew spiritual one materialistic effort determine ufo nature doomed failure hoax ranting due unstable personality suggested ufo report result prank hoax made people unstable personality attitude particularly prevalent time period air force investigation operated code name project grudge airline even went far ground every pilot reported seeing  flying saucer  way pilot regain flight status undergo psychiatric examination noticeable decline pilot report time interval interpreted decline prove ufo either hoax result unstable personality interest nicap national investigation committee aerial phenomenon even today stillreceives report commercial pilot neglect notify either air force airline number case indicate report fall hoax category examine one case socorro new mexico sighting made police sergeant lonnie zamora sergeant zamora patrolling street socorro april saw shiny object drift area gully edge town also heard loud roaring noise sounded old dynamite shed located way exploded immediately radioed police headquarters drove toward shed zamora forced stop yard away deep gully appeared overturned car radioed investigating possible wreck worked car onto mesa toward edge gully parked short walked final foot edge amazed see car instead weird eggshaped object fifteen foot long white color resting short metal leg beside unaware presence two humanoid dressed silvery coverall seemed working portion underside object zamora still standing surprised suddenly noticed dove sight around object zamora also headed way back toward car glanced back object bright blue flame shot underside within second eggshaped thing rose gully  earsplitting roar  object sight nearby mountain almost immediately sergeant zamora moving opposite direction almost fast met sergeant sam chavez responding zamora earlier radio call together investigated gully found bush charred still smoking blue flame jetted charred area four deep mark metal leg mark three one half inch deep circular shape sand gully hard packed sign humanoid footprint could found official investigation launched day data obtained supported story zamora chavez rather difficult label episode hoax also doubtful zamora chavez shared portion hallucination secret weapon individual proposed ufo actually advanced weapon system nature must revealed people accept credible suggestion natural phenomenon also suggested least possibly ufo case misinterpreted manifestation natural phenomenon undoubtedly suggestion merit people reported ufo object conclusively proven balloon weather skyhook planet venus manmade artificial satellite normal aircraft unusual cloud formation light ceilometers equipment projecting light beam cloud base determine height aircraft visual ceiling also suspected people reported mirage optical illusion swamp gas ball lightning poorlyunderstood discharge electrical energy spheroidal ellipsoidal shape  charge lasted fifteen minute ball usually bigger large orange difficult tell swamp dweller strange fastmoving light saw sky swamp gas difficult tell farmer bright ufo sky ball lightning seen rolling along fence wire dry weather thus accidental misidentification might well natural phenomenon breed mistrust disbelief lead hasty conclusion truth deliberatly told one last suggestion interest made ufo plasmoids space  concentrated blob solar wind succeeded reaching surface earth somehow last suggestion seem plausible perhaps ignores thing penetration earth magnetic field alien visitor stimulating theory u ufo material object either  manned  remotecontrolled being alien planet evidence supporting viewpoint addition police sergeant lonnie zamora experience let u consider case barney betty hill trip new england lost two hour night september without even realizing however night barney betty began developing psychological problem eventually grew sufficiently severe submitted psychiatric examination treatment course treatment hypnotherapy used yielded remarkably detailed similar story barney betty essentially hypotically kidnapped taken aboard ufo submitted twohour physicals released posthypnotic suggestion forget entire incident evidence rather strong hill even subconscious believe happened particular importance  posthypnotic block  removed hill ceased psychological problem hill description alien similar description provided case particular type alien appears minority commonly described alien three one half foot tall round head helmet arm reaching knee wearing silvery space suit coverall alien appear essentially earthman still others particularily wide wrap around eye mouth thin lip rare group reported four foot tall weight around pound covered thick hair fur clothing member last group described extremely strong being visiting earth two question arise nt attempted contact u officially answer first question may exist partially sergeant lonnie zamora experience may exist partially tunguska metor discussed chapter xxix chapter suggested tunguska metor actually comet exploded atmosphere ice melted dust spread hence debris however also suggested tunguska meteor actually alien spacecraft entered atmosphere rapidly suffered mechanical failure lost power supply andor weapon nuclear explosion hypothesis may seem far fetched sample tree ring around world reveal immediately tunguska meteor explosion level radioactivity world rose sharply short period time difficult find natural explanation increase radioactivity although suggestion advanced enough meteor great kinetic energy converted heat atmospheric friction fusion reaction occurred still leaf u answer second question contact question easy answer several way may object intensive sociological psychological study study usually avoid disturbing test subject environment  contact  colony ant human may seem way alien variation zoo fun visit dont  contact  lizard contact may already taken place secretly contact may already taken place different plane awareness yet sensitive communication plane reason may add list desire  human fear hostility besides foregoing reason contacting human downright dangerous think moment microscopic level body reject fight production antibody alien material process help u fight disease also sometimes result allergic reaction innocous material macroscopic psychological sociological level antagonistic being  different  proof watch odd child treated child minority group socially deprived arab feel israeli chinese v japanese turk v greek etc

ufo began pull away range reached  yard pilot armed gun fired attempt saucer failed ufo pulled away rapidly vanishing distance basic situation may happened personal level sunday evening august eight adult three child sutton farm onehalf mile kelly kentucky according one child saw brightly glowing ufo settle behind barn sight stood witness nearby farm also saw object however suttons dismissed  shooting star  investigate approximately thirty minute later  pm family dog began barking two men went back door looked approximately foot away coming toward creature wearing glowing silvery suit three onehalf foot tall large round head long arm large webbed hand equipped claw two suttons grabbed twelve gauge shotgun  caliber pistol fired close range could hear pellet bullet ricochet metal creature knocked jumped scrambled away suttons retreated house turned inside light turned porch light moment one woman peeking dining room window discovered creature sort helmet wide slit eye peeking back screamed men rushed started shooting creature knocked backwards scrambled away without apparent harm shooting occurred total round next minute creature finally left perhaps feeling unwelcome two hour wait safety suttons left time police got alien gone suttons would move back farm sold departed reported incident bear contention though human dangerous time story supposed alien shoot back although one left imprssion described creature fun scaring human  attempt scientific approach scientific endeavor first step aquire data second step classify data third step form hypothesis hypothesis tested repeating entire process cycle resulting increase understanding hope ufo phenomenon yield readily approach data taken far exhibit excessive variety vagueness vagueness caused part lack

interesting possibility consider suppose jupiter conjunction used every  month would satisfy observed period nicelly except every even data peak different magnitude every odd data peak perhaps combination martian jovian saturnian even planetary conjunction necessary match frequency plot  matched data correlation quite difficult large number different saucer shape may mean little example look number different type aircraft use u air force alone obvious intensive scientific study needed area study yet undertaken necessary level intensity needed something must guarded study trap
