monumental undertaking yet done many police department across country proven article detail step taken south portland maine police department enter world computerization chief police south portland decided expedite department recordkeeping process automation stipulated certain condition first task hand simplify department record without deleting part second  could used department budget third transition would handled officer assignment  acquire maintain new computer system first step talk neighboring police department town scarborough since police department also interested automating record system since also fund available officer assigned coordinate scarborough computerization effort arranged acquire jointly computer system police department provided immediate advantage could purchase computer system substantial discount since buying larger quantity joint venture later developed broad cooperative effort city south portland town scarborough sanford police department also created criminal justice information network grown statewide standard choosing right hardware software computer hardware concentrated first hardware need primarily computer downtime caused hardware problem software ease installation low maintenance cost well readily accessible longterm hardware support major concern know need first contacted major vendor mean reverse bid vendor submitted nonbinding hardware proposal believed needed proposal allowed department compare justify speed processing requirement ram requirement main memory storage provided excellent springboard u write actual bid also made easier see much money would left purchase software vendor placed bid met representative vendor let explain system better could department eyeopening experience often vendor literature boasted bid time always exactly purchaser actually received also allowed u make educated progressive decision toward accurately assessing longer term need considering option decided purchase minimainframe would allow easier expansion minimal cost also minimainframe computer terminal added onehalf cost purchasing separate personal computer computer software world computer software inundated buzzer bell flashing color point major software vendor put excellent presentation package yet even though software package everything world user could want also accompanied price tag ranging   packaged system contain number good feature also feature wanted needed example criminal justice software package come standard computeraided dispatch system yet department feature unnecessary therefore wanted since vendor could supply applicable software package within price range decided contact another police department maine developed software using relational database management approach software written informix sql rdbms system cover topic complaint accident propertycase control uniform crime reporting also flexible allows system administrator customize program meet individual need department important factor consider offered u free charge system provided everything needed also allowed u remain well within budget came hardest part whole process  task implementing automated system implementing system without proper planning implementing computer system stressful usually simple install hardware run wiring far operational stage technical assistance hardware software vendor usually fairly painless purchase software package vendor followup support therefore deal following item without benefit software  expert  software installation system administration customization documentation training software installation installing software usually fairly simple installer simply follow direction load system one disk time case hardware vendor set equipment helpful point operating system part original bid system administration system administration major concern point inhouse system administrator take daytoday role problem solver computer system work person better know solve problem least telephone number someone however take someone computer background solve problem case three department system system administrator could use resource consultant important police department officer system administrator usually duty perform may time become completely familiar system operates customization customization process taking generic computer program tailoring department exact need one advantage informix sql rdbms system purchased software package program customized duplicate currently used form report training time greatly reduced officer also rewrite information gathered dispatcher data entry personnel already familiar computerized format another feature customized system prompting line bottom computer screen prompting line ask user proper data enter field example user attempting make numerical entry accidentally typed letter alphabet computer screen would flash tell user entry invalid another strong point system alteration could made immediately additional cost majority software package market today much difficult unless system administrator extensive experience training computer programming type system anyone learn make change without specialized computer education documentation documentation important step process time data entered change made system preserved reason backup copy made month retained well hard copy code event system failure added precaution backup data stored offsite case fire type disaster training department staffed civilian dispatcher officer could assigned dispatch duty week cycle therefore system become fully operational everyone department receive training purchased commercial software package support personnel vendor showing answer question solve problem added fact department personnel computer literate therefore decided write handbooktutorial would lead officer stepbystep entire process data entry printing file kept handbook instruction simple possible example type login push return key work make sure monitor turned type login may seem oversimplified faced training officer worked different shift much effective also wrote handbook include example program screen handbook placed terminal extra copy handed officer next step allow everyone experiment system month time officer entered data system hard copy kept case mistake time arranged formal training small group officer sixty day going operational system completely online training continued handbook updated amended needed officer became comfortable system learned use advanced command system shortcut supervisor also received additional training could help officer assigned particular shift operational consideration throughout process became obvious prior research various hardware vendor definitely paid example case problem question hardware vendor system telephone number put user contact engineer engineer could either dial system modem case diagnose problem phone result year operation system experienced downtime due hardware software problem finally need grew software package particular police department needed program parking ticket written documented copy given police department customize use system expanded include program effectively meet need participating police department conclusion even though may seem like monumental undertaking vision insight forethought police department enter computer age relative ease important accomplished cost effectively quote technical report national consortium justice information statistic noted   information system  excellent software package capable meeting principle management operational information need law enforcement agency throughout state maine implementation numerous agency within outside state testimony
