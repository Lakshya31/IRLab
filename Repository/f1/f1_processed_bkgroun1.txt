openness   niels bohr introduction  weapon openness  best weapon democracy openness mean public access information needed making public decision increased public access ie le secrecy also give information adversary thereby increasing strength  weapon openness  net contribution increased openness ie le secrecy make survival society bohr believed gain strength openness democracy exceeded gain adversary thus openness weapon made plausible darwinian argument open society evolved fittest survive reproduce international jungle thus strength weapon openness tested proven battle imitation technology developed vigorously precisely time ie industrial revolution precisely place western europe america greatest openness existed gorbachev glasnost recognition correlation alive well today let u note immediately secrecy surprise clearly essential weapon war even country like u justifiably prided openness made great frequently successful effort use secrecy wartime weapon bohr phrase coined following wwii primary concern living nuclear weapon paper concerned impact secrecy v openness policy development military technology long duration peacetime rivalry let u also immediately note publication route reward academic science technology publication denied culture change toward standard hierarchical culture reward dependent finding favor superior reward publication remarkably successful stimulating independent thinking however assessing openness v secrecy policy must borne mind research worker including present author start strong bias favoring openness contrast secrecy insider come culture access deeper secret conveys higher status  get ahead  culture secrecy understand us personal advancement knowledge power many insider access classified information chief source power surprising secrecy insider see publication technological information endangering national security hand degree accept insider assurance operation subject public scrutiny free marketplace control strengthen democracy experience relates secrecy technology therefore discus secret submarine position seem perfectly justifiable sense clearly add strength activity kept secret avoid difficulty explaining policy choice public seem disastrously divisive first offer clue understanding historical military strength openness long duration competition secrecy second suggest procedure utilization openness increase strength strength openness important source support secrecy technology ancient confusion magic science many communication addressed layman term used almost interchangeably magic depends secrecy create illusion science depends openness progress major part educated public medium adequately understood profound difference magic science important failure educational system one source lack general appreciation power openness source military strength general understanding power openness would bolster faith open society would continue fittest survive openness necessary process trial elimination error sir karl popper beautiful description mechanism progress science let try understand happens process secret project perhaps shed light peacetime military able justly acquire reputation resistance novelty trial popper language mean receptivity unexpected conjecture tradition young outsider challenging conventional wisdom however real life always difficult really new idea heard victory almost impossible hierarchical structure usual way new idea heard sold first outside hierarchy project secret much difficult whether inventor inside outside project impediment elimination error determine pace progress science many matter important distinguish two type error call ordinary cherished error ordinary error corrected without embarrassment powerful people elimination error cherished powerful people prestige political financial reason adversary process open science adversary process conducted open meeting scientific journal secret project almost inevitably becomes political battle outcome depends political strength although rhetoric usually employ much scientific jargon advance technology incorporate planning process addition trial elimination error basic life planned advance small planning dominant sense little new knowledge required significant error must anticipated planned advance large usually involve research invention process trial elimination error discussed determine rate progress case advantage openness especially important familiar disappointment meeting schedule budget frequently related fact selling new program importance unpredictable process sufficiently emphasized openness would reduce disappointment trial elimination error essential significant progress military technology thus aspect process significant progress made military technology sharply decelerated secrecy widespread peacetime openness accelerates progress peacetime military technology openness weapon one clue survival open society international jungle secrecy instrument corruption side coin weakness secrecy foster instrument corruption well illustrated reagan executive order national security alarmingly tightening secrecy state sec  case shall information classified order conceal violation law inefficiency administrative error prevent embarrassment person organization agency restrain competition prevent delay release information require protection interest national security section order criminal conceal crime inefficient conceal inefficiency beyond provides abbreviated guide crucial role secrecy process whereby power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely corruption secrecy important clue strength openness one important impact corruption secrecy making major technical decision federally sponsored project especially project hotly contested strategic defense initiative must always keep constituency mind making decision thus leadership must ask whether continual search ally served making purely technical decision one way purely technical decision might determine whether money flow ohio texas worse yet revealing technical weakness could impact project budget search ally occurs unclassified project technical criticism come scientific community outside project must considered consideration criticism improve decision making process dramatically bringing measure power scientific method making major technical decision classified project vested interest grow around decision frequently prevent questioning authority necessary elimination error peacetime classified project bad record rejecting imaginative suggestion frequently threatening existing political power structure technical information classified public technical criticism inevitably degrade medium contest competing authority competition attention never clear whether politics science speaking lose power science credibility democratic process corruption progressive disease diffuses person person across society direct observation efficacy safety efficacy abuse secrecy interagency rivalry personal advancement well illustrated array abuse listed sec  safety abuse secrecy abuser dependent upon enforcement section abuse spread become norm enforcibility decline corruption diffuses rapidly however diffusive process take time spread organization make possible secrecy make significant contribution national strength crisis new organization created respond emergency example scientific organization created start wwii behavior norm group recruited may tolerate abuse secrecy personal advancement interagency rivalry case short time secrecy may effective tactic general belief strength secrecy rest partially shortterm success entered wwii welldeveloped secrecy system corruption would developed time convinced result would quite different secrecy exacerbates divisiveness sdi example reagan executive order previously referred provides another clue power openness preamble state order recognizes essential public informed concerning activity government interest united state citizen require certain information concerning national defense foreign relation protected unauthorized disclosure tension statement resolved order may informative attempt resolution considering concrete example namely strategic defense initiative sdi symbolizes one conflict clearly exacerbated secrecy currently divide u would assert unilateral step toward openness could take would leave u unified stronger even reciprocal step taken soviet propose start unclassified research program designed provide scientific information needed making public policy program uncoupled classified program emphasis would compromise classified information purpose would provide knowledge base public policy discussion program would reveal decision taken secretly public knowledge base would reduce debilitating divisiveness fostered secrecy strategic defense initiative provides classic example debilitating divisiveness countermeasure sdi deeply classified deadly game countermeasure countercountermeasures probably determine whether sdi successful largescale maginot line present time classification countermeasure area trivializes public debate medium battle opposed authority offering conflicting interpretation secret information example game decoying v discrimination offense proliferate multitude decoy discriminated warhead defense sdi succeed knowing decoy design would course make easier adversary discriminate warhead therefore important design carefully guarded hand maintaining secrecy scientific engineering research basic decoyingdiscrimination technology would reason discussed earlier make much difficult provide assurance public avenue explored indeed substantial part criticism feasibility sdi turn possibility adversary would invent countermeasure would unprepared cryptography case uncoupled open program learn something efficiency secret v open program peacetime objection raised adm bobby r inman former director national security agency open program cryptography nsa large secret agency claimed open program conducted handful matheticians around world access nsa secret would reveal country code insecure research might lead code even nsa could break objection exhibit nsa assessment best secret effort country could mount would miss technique would revealed even small open uncoupled program true country possible also applies u inman asserted  overlap technical information national security inevitably produce tension tension result scientist desire unrestrained research publication one hand federal government need protect certain information potential foreign adversary might use information nation would assert uncoupled open program uop cryptography make america stronger provide early warning capability adversary might breaking code many instance secret bureaucracy disastrously overestimated invulnerability code case see tension national interest openness cryptographer provided fine case study strengthening weapon openness consider value starting unclassified relatively cheap academic research program uncoupled classified program uop could provide solid information countermeasure needed informed political decision sdi open cryptography research taught u something security code indeed sdi critic right opportunity invention countermeasure uop would provide opportunity make conclusive case hand open program exhibited sdi could deal countermeasure suggested retain effectiveness case would strengthened open program would indeed shared world would strengthen u even response ussr reducing corruption secrecy improving decision making reducing divisiveness undertaking program would exhibit commitment strengthening weapon openness making commitment would enable democratic control military technology openness reducing suspicion area american divided increase military strength unifying country ally could possibly increase military strength enemy weapon openness future bohr phrase keynote article invented effort adapt demand social change required live advancing military technology unfortunately bohr effort persuade fdr churchhill desirability openness living nuclear weapon complete failure doubt future bring even rapid rate progress sciencebased technology let mention three possibility noting foreseeable development surprise past guide still important artificial intelligence advancing driven enormous economic potential challenge understanding brain function molecular biology genetic
