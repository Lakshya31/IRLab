wound care scrape suture george e dvorchak jr md skin cover body important function pro tecting internal organ tissue environment physical object technically protective covering also largest body organ first line defense jury bacteria injury outer layer skin epidermis either scraped away openedup permit bacteria material enter severe wound next layer downward dermis penetrated contains connective tissue sweat gland hair follicle nerve lymph blood vessel generally speaking deeper wound serious consequence body survivalist want prepared anything time therefore best approach presentation wound care cover everything simple closed wound serious injury skin compromised wound therefore referred open closed wound skin common bruise contusion caused blunt object impacting upon body result blood begin leak injured vessel skin cause area change color black blue good thing injury skin broken infection great possibili ty therefore immediate first aid treatment apply ice minute throughout day even though skin broken could still serious problem one depending injured beneath skin amount force originally caused injury internal organ abdominal area severely injured bleeding could taking place internally without evidence externally traveling hunting horse injury could happen simply stopping adjust load pack horse get spooked kicked internal injury could result hard kick abdomen day medical care could cause internal bleeding may fatal obvious time open wound skin category everything bandaid suture necessary along special consideration concern beginning least serious six major category open wound abrasion outer surface skin scraped away scratch rope burn usually minor oozing blood serum depending injury obtained usually dirt foreign matter ground problem brings light another player wound healing infection treatment go beyond application ice treat abrasion scraped knee wound must first cleansed soap water available hydrogen peroxide remove dirt cause infection therefore impair healing cleaned wound blotted dry clean cloth preferably sterile gauze would also good idea apply pressure injured site minute purpose slowing hopefully stopping bleeding application first aid antibiotic cream abrasion could help prevent infection keep bandage apply sticking raw wound best protec tion bandage cover inch beyond wound ice pack final bandage serve reduce swelling discomfort next category wound incision made sharp knifelike object leaf clean cut keep one separated next think surgi cal incision cut edge smooth third laceration similar jagged edge due tear go beyond outer layer skin deeper layer contain blood vessel lot bleeding deep enough unlucky enough cut artery blood squirt heart beat due high pressure vessel best approach apply pressure dressing get medical care su tures usually needed fully partially close wound depending dirty clean suturing common medical procedure later outline information involved better inform doctor op tions next wound puncture name implies foreign object pushed skin could splinter penetrates superficial layer skin nail sharp stick fishing hook penetrates deeper usually see much external blood mean little internal bleeding treat something puncture wound foot nail put ice along pressure wrapping get medical care critical since already protected tetanus need get injection protection outdoors lot pay keep immunization updated next skin wound avulsion skin pulled torn amputation severed tissue saved taken hospital finger pressure dressing stump skin pressure dressing wound one medical facility reached one point addressed concerning  serious wound  dressing dressing applied leave alone take every minute check wound unnecessarily disturbed undo positive measure already applied wound management summary first concern wound control bleeding first aid level usually mean use pressure bandage next concern prevent wound contamination refers cleaning wound applying sterile bandage possibly antibiotic oint ment lastly immobilization inured part along rest severe medical intervention wise procedure mystery suture many u growing sewn back together father small town gp put six leg another six seven chin age like wanted get therefore could cared detail following give general summary suturing encom pass hopefully help lift curtain mystery concerning common procedure suture thread like material attached curved needle used straight one absorbable used internally nonabsorbable used internally externally holding skin together material used nonabsorbables concerned made silk cotton nylon dermal stainless steel one reason different material concern tissue reac tion something foreign body even though serving purpose body know foreign substance within body react invader get tissue reaction reason stainless steel popular surgery surgeon suture material evokes least tissue reaction suture size also important since different material weight thread matched task tissue generally speaking suture material stronger tissue expected hold together suture silk nylon widely used holding skin together size designated   etc smaller number stronger material hold skin together generally used needle attached thread either straight curved curved commonly used doctor office one curved needle holder hemostat required use friend mine orthopedic surgeon told would recommend straight needle use outdoors close skin since needle holder needed using continuous suture straight needle would quickest way close skin wound heading remote area feel would like know would recommend ask family doctor advice since best know would one advise yet laceration pressure dressing wound would preferred procedure medical care would available another consideration doctor careful skin sutured back together edema swelling tissue usually enters picture suture originally tight swelling soon tight therefore proper tension first time job done critical good healing purpose suturing pull tissue together enough dead space skin blood fluid accumulate eventually breeding ground infection staying su tures put also important amount tissue included side suture suture includes tissue one side andor needle inserted deeper one side tied togeth er skin edge overlap causing poor wound healing andor scar doctor want put severed edge back like accident body complete job healing medical emergency laceration happen anywhere worst place medical care readily available would highly recommend red cross first aid course completed would recommend take advanced course hopefully get certified emergency medical technician also go outfitted back country hunt one question ask outfitterguide certified first aid event guide would get inured would also everyone advantage qualified help rule good medicine
