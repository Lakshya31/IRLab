information disclaimer modification may void warranty computer component take responsibility damage may caused making modification introduction  simple modification allows standard ibm pc type parallel port used bidirectional bit io port use application control sensing monitoring high speed data trasfer warning attempt read data parallel port using non modified standard printer port card l octal buffer sink current may overheat done handshake line also open collector output requirement  piece insulated copper wire inch long soldering iron solder maybe desoldering wick sharp tool cutting pcb track ttl data book handy parallel printer port schematic help digital multimeter testing ibm type parallel printer card either original single card multi function card may possible modify type parallel port since similar design pc however special card use single vlsi controller chip perform function entire multifunction card may modified course note laptop computer generally bidirectional parallel printer port note however bidirectional port use opencollector output parallel data bus may require pullup resistor connected standard modified port data trasfer method hardware mod

register therefore software work normal printing operation work custom software alters direction register software may problem printing printer ready signal paper error may generated resolved either clearing data direction register use debug example resetting computer software interface  use bit io port data trasfer following software used assumes parallel printer port located hex o case subtract suitable value eg h printer hex register address setting port output mode normal printer output clear bit data direction register formerly unused hex eg inportb xa outporb x xdf  output mode  outporb
