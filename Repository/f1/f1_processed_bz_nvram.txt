upgrade designed machine save top highscores meremortals get score sheet occasionally also designed saved high score cleared reseting machine one coin switch held fix implemented replacing battlezone existing program ram batterybackedultralowerpowercmossram new eprom blown convince battlezone initialize area ram used high score unless operator want happen battery zeropower replacement sram going use last year highscores safe quite read detail couple time plan fix nt always got thing exactly correct order   sir launcelot sir galahad jump rabbit    detail      rate upgrade  easyish  scale  trivial   impossible  please take infinite care upgrading battlezone machine close heart number alltime great list imho hate hear one functional machine recovering  upgrade  half fix software patch enless scope different variation stick one example patch follow later mean need access eprom programmer use upgrade part list number part list        k x eprom mkz k x zero power tm sram pin dil socket pin dil socket expensive part zero powered sram cost pound first describe hardware change talk software change hardware     firstly need disable two static ram battlezone currently us program ram going install dont want fighting socket h j ram question location h j battlezone cpu board larger one reset button desoldered chip installed socket disable anyway like remember careful desoldering chip old board wire track board tendency peel away board rediscovered horror add jumper wire two hardest stage fix take time nt damage board need access pin either h j later disable chip way bare mind removed solder new pin socket insert original retest board machine everything ok might good time ensure battlezone power supply producing greater v adjust small trim pot audio card nt new sram going install protect voltage low piggyback socket eprom next stage solder socket back replacement eprom chip going use replace prom location n labelled  something best rom already programed new data detailed pin socket connected eprom also find socket hole centre wont able erase eprom change patch without desoldering thing eprom eraser enough head room problem erasing programming eprom even socket attached socket  u  socket eprom side           rw socket hole gbar         solder pin together ebar        eprom         blowup socket eprom connection        socket                 solder

socket connect pin one vacant socket h j summary socket pin connected            ebar pin socket h j ram select ground gbar ground rw pin socket h j readwrite signal plug play assuming patched eprom plug play carefully remove prom socket n plug eprom socket back n connect single core jumper wire vacant h j socket insert z socket back eprom n hold right coin slot switch reset score switch machine still working wait monitor warm working patch described release document start high score entire high score table blank seems ok game check thing still work ok top score remembered power put old andor eprom back problem help isolate problem software     software fix fortunately code need patching one rom unfortunately intention broadcasting atari code across net obvious reason make change find way edit binary file rom ok patch weird format invented fff b ad f c e fa f e c ca f f c ae ea ea ea several way patch binary image read original  loaded code memory monitor tool edited change hand saved simple enough write simple perl c program automatically change code language available get completely stuck editor also allow edit binary data hex also ideal way change rom represents code address x xfff new data need entered starting xb xae therefore x xe byte start file eg xb need set xa xb need set x etc  first line contain start end address  rom next list byte placed certain location       patch              start location rom fff   end location rom b   st lot change start ad f c e fa f e c ca f f c ae   another lot change start ea ea ea                           need know patch however

problem        main problem patch nt look test mode code yet data rom changed battlezone test mode spot complains effect normal operation put rom test mode problem may case juggling checksum rom match original one may complicated also test mode might mess score location testing ram looking problem post new patch pas test mode figured someone beaten simply nt enter testmode really need check thing put original rom sram back first battery lifetime         z spec say lifetime battery almost independent amount time chip backup mode lifetime dependent solely temperature average chip battery lifetime year degree c also chip lifetime year degress c future      load possibility future enhancement discussed various folk still byte rom space left fix would possible use space initialize lower score something zero quite liked blank zero entry left way rather top score reset user could select many score saved using dip switch unfortunately nt enough spare switch battlezone could hijack language setting switch would also free bucket rom space program ram saved might possible implement pause game feature could switch machine resume switched back remember address line new sram tied gnd well probably possible tie pin straight double amount program ram available future patch decode appears alright appears room memory map nt tried yet game could similar fix well send schematic know might able tried make fix described general possible explaining stage detail easy describing specific fix hopefully may similar fix board one would interested hear board people manage apply principle
