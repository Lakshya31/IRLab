ignorance lock pickproof anyone maintains defrauding customer variety way increase picking difficulty discussed elsewhere best bet borrow one somewhere evening spend time learning innards determining unknown combination contrary marketing rep would believe lock opened fairly quickly without knowing set combination without damaging lock blend soft touch little hard logic implicit understanding locking mechanism work generally yield within five minute always exception  method requires one think term sequence button press one must think term tumbler position simply use button place tumbler desired practical description purpose assumed button connect right tumbler rather idler gear really idler gear necessary part combination change unless change considering way pretty close fact remember position mean button never pushed enabled shifted far possible turning thumb handle right clockwise raise locking bar tumbler since lock never machined perfectly one tumbler pressure one show friction turned via button friction felt short distance fullyextended detent button first mm travel travel easily detent others resist effort push suppose twisting handle tumbler lot pressure feel try push button back tension handle little bit button pushed resistance fact button resistance position tell tumbler proper position would pressure notch upon pushing button find pressure appeared button eliminates position tumbler also get tumbler different position test pressure one push subsequent button push button tumbler advance position ignore tumbler moment perhaps another button resistance mean tumbler either right position getting close basically using tumbler find thing one question keep mind first one friction wo nt always tumbler tumbler could first pressure continuing push another  nt care  button  dont care  button one one trying evaluate one recently showed friction want advance tumbler without disturbing anything else pressure test tumbler get stronger disappear got stronger point even higher probability tumbler supposed rather pressure vanished became le gone far safer position let assume pressure test tumbler increased slightly tumbler increased even tumbler vanished pushed onward reset lock know proper position tumbler whatever tumbler first pressure already drastically reduced number possible combination nt finished yet eliminate position next one two tumbler way  set thing feel pressure must ensure newlyknown tumbler case proper position useful make little chart tumbler position indicate probability correct position position         l l l  indicates tumbler maybe likely tumbler number l  indicates tumbler chart simply bunch little vertical line drawn x matrix topmost row corresponds button lowest mark probability little hash mark appropriate height leftmost bar indicates position rightmost high mark left side indicates tumbler never used relative height tick mark indicate likelihood notch respective tumbler nt know position nt mark yet chart serf useful mnemonic learning trick gain experience probably wo nt need anymore remember tumbler position tumbler position already lined button pressed feel like lot loose play little bit pressure end travel enable detent aware often enough first button pressure arent watching position easily assume nt care push screw chance feeling others make sure  nt care  test button nt supposed either good idea run try find zero first thing let u continue found tumbler likely bet position slim chance position marked chart reason happen top locking bar teeth slightly rounded tumbler one away opening position locking bar actually rise higher since notch halfway already nt assume first increase pressure button right position one finding let assume next pressure showed button feel tumbler position get tumbler let say used sequence   nt care  button used push around therefore tumbler position therefore felt pressure next step find proper position next button pressure tumbler many time get one exhibit pressure time figure button pressure first tumbler right position example applies want advance tumbler different place keeping proper place must always advance free locking bar enough press tumbler place tumbler position position would something like  check place tumbler position would something like  place press time advance mess two position use notation  mean also  put check test fail pressure appears button start assuming supposed way position example let say  pressure showed button doublecheck  pressure went away tumbler must gone far time place fairly high tick mark chart tumbler position indicate probability note better way last test avoid ambiguity  check  check ensures change made move tumbler avoids possibility movement tumbler giving bogus result entire process want try change one thing time every point sometimes one sort possible test setup wo nt tell anything try another one case perhaps   checking simply swapped position testing know two tumbler position high degree confidence reduced possible combination could mix tumbler  sequence various permutation long place correctly every time would still take time brain work  let try find something button place supposed go  sequence  see button  leave available find eventually next bit pressure distributed nonzero feel like described confirm advance along button check bingo pressure enabled changed anything else besides position firmly decide leave advancing usual feel pressure first place know proper position three tumbler eliminated zero feeling initial pressure since next pressure try find know nt zero suppose try must get one usual leave alone use hitherto unknown button dummy position tumbler right instance sequence  want check pressure  check may notice pressure leftover little stronger enough make sure judgement well want advance unknown position suddenly notice something like  free button left test pressure time try possibility unknown must advance proper position leaving alone sprinkling unknown around sequence different permutation use chart remember known tumbler must go sometimes get two possibility tumbler must work permutation also particular example know either must last button pressed since something get pressed advance position obvious thing try putting unknown position  try handle see open okay leave one unknown mix one around instance   nope advance one  click  huh oh hey open well quite dancing around room know possibility ran follows  end permutation  permutation involving   one may see thing like  x eliminated fact must get must stay still since button could used tumbler get position particular combination note also farther tumbler go earlier button pressed seems confusing first go carefully try visualize happening inside box feel button likely set lock exactly example since slightly different substitute first pressure button example may even one exhibit pressure two tumbler initially apply differentialpressure idea way find likely position example demonstrate method work really understand set lock kind combination apply method opening watching work time understand going able lock assembled sleep waving hand mumbling  press
