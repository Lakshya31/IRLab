 introduction primo operating system part iv prime network communication written violence copyright c void hacker  welcome part iv continuing series primo operating system installment plan covering prime network communication capability associated utilites find useful like popular mainframe prime networking capability support many communication application prime main communication product primenet rje dptx going primenet series discourse rje dptx beyond scope series good discussion rje dptx refer magic hassan excellent article subject appearing phrack inc issue  primenet available model prime computer primenet prime networking software nutshell primenet like token ring lan network primenet superior token ring lan application however really able visualize primenet ring network operates need familiar token ring type lan local area network token ring basically circle computer referred node electronically connec ted eachother individual prime computer primenet ring re ponsible allowing remote user able access however prime net simply allows simplified communication netted system following diagram see sample primenet ring six prime compu ters located individual node may may connected telephone network another primenet ring one many public data network pdn like telenet example manner primenet ring set prime prime  prime prime prime prime node receives information neighboring system transmits node immediately downstream ring fashion node send information node sending others stated previously primenet ring network superior token ring lan application way feature primenet system listed terminal primenet ring login system primenet ring process running time different system communicate interactively transparent access system primenet network without use additional command protocol complete access protocol support packetswitched communication primenet system mainframe located almost public data network pdn feature allow thing like access disk partition system system b rlogin system system b requiring account system b forth installment explain many thing primenetequipped system  checking primenet system get primenetequipped system thing learn intrasystem link section describe procedure need initiate order determine said information first thing use three dsm distributed system management utility remember described dsm full part ii three dsm utility external command really invoke listprimenetlinks list primenet status listprimenetnodes list configured primenet node listprimenetports list assigned primenet port information returned external command describe current primenet setup detail obtain remote nodenames primenet address link device gateway node configured access whether individual node require remote password login good examp le result obtained listprimenetnodes ok listprimenetnodes  void  remote primenet link gateway configured validation node address device node access required                                        hz lhc remote login rfa thrash xxx pnc remote login rfa yes violen xxx sync remote login rfa yes psycho sync remote login rfa scyth xxx sync remote login rfa                                        assumes issued listprimenetnodes command system void state primenet ring system name found  remote node  column note  primenet address  column list system nua network user address notice three listed nua telenet two bizarre network dnic data network identification code well host system void located telenet pdn dnic thus dsm know system telenet display telenet address system dnic located foreign pdn dsm understand addressing scheme default understands host system thusly display primenet address  link device  column tell hardware individual site host system device displayed node ring net work lhc lan node controller pnc primenet node controller pnc sync denotes synchronous communication line important unless hardware fanatic  configured access   validation required  column display important information linked system nt see  remote login  login system remotely access one primenet system linked disk partition however see  yes   validation required  column sort remote password system installed going hard time getting see dsm command useful attempting gain access system primenet lan ring rest installment devoted utilizing information gained  primenet rlogin facility primenet support remote logins manner unix machine example primenet ring system telenet uk could connect system uk free connecting one u system rloging one uk prime using already defined primenet ring connect system psycho system thrash xxx connected primenet  thrash login system system psycho log systemsystem psycho node prime separate thrash node useful lost acc ounts one node primenet ring know nua one ring system still account  netlink netlink prime network utility user primenet system access communication utility netlink allows connect prime primenet ring system system unix vaxen etc located world network netlink powerful utility abuse lead account removal careful use best thing possibly use connect hack system primenet ring must use netlink utility call system world pdn try call system accept collect call let tell get netlink start stuff ok prompt whatever set logincpl file type ok netlink netlink available see something like herald netlink rev  copyright c prime computer inc serial serialnumber companyname float across screen deposited netlink pro mpt happens   gee original ready begin netlinking time learn connect system three type comm ands basically thing connect remote system go first two type right save third type bit later depending status system trying call use either c connect nc connect reverse charging c nc thing c make connection free ie people prime wo nt get bill nc make connection net use charged ok good comparison calling nua pdn nua  collectable  term use describe system accepts collect ie id required make connection call use c command otherwise use nc command almost international call require nc connect simply want call system listed listprimenetnodes list c nodename example would c thrash wanted call system located pdn primenet system accepts collect call c network address example would c want call system located pdn pdn primenet c dnic network address example would c  regardless actually end typing get one two thing connect message error message connect message exa mple would look like connected connect message connect prime primenet ring would look like thrash connected ok simply login hack normally would done logoff system usual logoff get message like disconnected occasionally either type nua incorrectly system calling happens get error message look like rejecting clearing code diagnostic code packet type invalid error message state network address tried call le dnic clearing code diagnostic code diagnostic code mean english end file complete list clearing code diagnostic code reference sub net bitnet etc read  message cr next msg op  prime file name predatr date sun may  youth international party line kentucky  sub net bitnet etc read  message cr next msg  prime file name predatr date sun may  youth international party line kentucky want abort session prematurely recommended unless netlink screw occasion three thing type controlp issue break sequence return telenet force disconnect via command listed order try controlp work time break usually always close connection return primo level break probably see uuu uuu quit ok press return clear unwanted control character prime command line input buffer restart netlink usual forced drop telenet disconenct relogin process still online time nt worry logged due inactivity minute proc es got slain good shape return netlink usual ok know connect disconnect system time fun stuff multipadding advanced command escape character netlink   character telenet basically type cr cr return netlink online take back netlink command mode leave circuit open reconnect system type continue reconnected system slight draw back using telenet pdn us telenet software using netlink escape sequence cr cr take back telenet network command level instead back netlink command level two way correct problem first type following netlink prompt change netlink prompt prompt type cr cr return netlink way utilize telenet iti parameter turn escape sequence connect primenet login return telenet command level type two sequence parameter ex actly shown set  set  return   prompt type cont return prime enter netlink usual type cr cr wo nt return tele net used ok let get multipadding exactly  multipadding  anyways well probably already know never hurt repeat multi padding connected two system simultaneously basically netlink allow capability although netlink documentation state connect four system one time actually connect rate first enter netlink note must set prompt iti parameter plan netlinking primenet located telenet pdn us telenet software connect first system typing call nodename  located primenet ring call network address  system located pdn call dnic net address  system located different pdn call command connect system remain netlink command mode keep calling system done forewarned confusing connected four system ok call example assumed system calling accept collect call case call like call whatever fcty  fcty  command stand facility ok use  fcty  argument basically thing using nc connect command call make open circuit first circuit connect known circuit forth ready connect first system type continue connect second open circuit type continue forth try connect closed circuit get following error message circuit exist switch system return netlink command mode via cr cr continue appropriate circuit close particular circuit type actual circuit number example would must space circuit number disconnect open circuit type pretty much multipadding nothing special really useful interesting connect two three chat system switch hang chat leave hack system remaining chat etc lot interesting thing done using netlink type q quit return primo would like see command yeah covering article type help got basic go
