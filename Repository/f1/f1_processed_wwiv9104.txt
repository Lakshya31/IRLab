volume issue          date       stop hack attack bethnal black recent rash wwiv hacking montreal area shown many sysops taking right precaution make system safe secure simple thing like backup seem foreign sysops first line defense crash hacked otherwise regular backup need time consuming activity initial system backup done incremental backup disk may take little minute backing disk may enjoyable task nt life threatening either may save quite bit time trouble later backup situation covered start thing ensure never use disk first step protect ever accidentally erase file difficult really quite easy prevent do provided command called attrib allows set readonly flag do file start commandcom autoexecbat configsys bbscom bbsexe anything else think file set readonly deleted accidentally clobbered vicious hacker protecting commandcom also added benefit stopping large number virii infecting system look specifically recent hack making round pkunzip extraction hack use feature initexe program simply restrict uploads sysop check everything come board making available download therefore extractabletotemp always easy especially get lot uploads best way insure safety particular hack another good stopper one wayne bell unzip program better yet remove extract option together anyone ever used think also important remember one basic rule computer security change password system regularly practice applies user enforced high access account also nt give system password anybody nt know ca nt kill even absolutely necessary never log onto bb remotely make password totally random even wouldnt know voice validation another way ensuring user act responsibly phone number know doesnt minute conversation either quick chat let know bb expect user give user feeling wanted give chance size decide someone need watched maybe even restricted realize probably heard stuff probably know way protect bb damage rest hope given insight protect investment time effort call  board  invite appreciate comment  fidonet wwivnet perspective east bay ray popularity fidonet gate wwivnet growing rapidly day check net listing see many node number  range however many sysops confused first plunge fidonet two network indeed vastly different article address major difference fidonet wwivnet fundamental point view would take least book software point view first dealing single type bb software even dealing single type operating system computer fidonet system run dec rainbow ataris apple well pc running msdos o unix pcmos must realize unlike wwivnet everybody nt run software people different problem fidonet software even commercial second several different piece networking software available nt one author one set program use diverse number choice software mainly divided two category mailer messaging software mailer also called frontend program run connects fidonet system mailer dial send fidonet packet file fidonet system receive well mailer also driving force behind freqing  file requesting  sysops heard snarf idea mailer call another mailer request file also call system request file done program second major portion fidonet software messaging software program one unarc unzip packet received mailer put message directory surprised yes fidonet got wise long time ago started sending compressed mail system fidonetcompatible bb system directly read message output messaging software wwiv sysop however must take extra step get fidonet mail board program called netsex explained detail little bit later article third major difference fidonet wwivnet mail structured fidonet want guy excessively annoyed connect anyone want pretty much practice nt smart possibility another realistic example really want get piece mail someone across country simply  crash mail  practice write letter call system directly send letter really speed thing sometimes go wish introduce new term basically synonym fidonet term nevertheless first netmail email net email wwivnet fidonet region routed netmail send piece netmail place country go longer cheaper route much like wwivnet region netmail must go directly destination system go second term echomail echomail synonymous wwivnet post however echomail  conference  net sub vastly different wwivnet one fidonet echomail conference wwivnet standard freeforalls although appointed moderator moderator little knowledge picking conference little control go another fidonet concept used currently wwivnet message threading replychaining technique employed bb system degree allows post relating topic read time regardless posted make reading message infinitely easier reader nodelist file huge file contains listing fidonet system currently network yet distributed basis regular irregular since close megabyte around system fidonet far would highly impractical send file poor yes couple baud system would spent entire week downloading nodelist instead weekly nodediffs distributed compressed format arc zip lzh etc nodediff file contains difference last week nodelist week think present time besides netsex utility required interface wwiv fidonet available netszip pretty much left fidonet software untouched hopefully future issue people wwivnet know fidonet software write review heavy benny hill pierre tremblay darkster otto grin   pending file tip trick news wwivnews staff wayne bell due recent upsurge hack
