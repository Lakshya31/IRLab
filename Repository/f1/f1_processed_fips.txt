welcome fips first nondestructive interactive partition splitting program version  october copyright  arno schaefer need use fips introduction fips safety restriction start use stackersuperstordoublespace use o use multitasking o use ontrack disk manager using fips splitting partition commandline switch troubleshooting credit fips program designed split existing do partition

without warranty without even implied warranty merchantability fitness particular purpose see gnu general public license detail received copy gnu general public license along fips see file copying write free software foundation mass ave cambridge usa report problem direct question schaefer rbginformatikthdarmstadtde need use fips need defragmentation program order move data beginning hard disk fips split partition enough free space end do  later contains defrag suitable purpose suitable program norton speedisk actually defrag speedisk le function licensed norton pctools compress diskopt novell do shareware program org dog safpak available anonymous ftp simtel mirror diskutil directory test however nt blame nt work may also want use program like norton disk doctor scandisk do  check harddisk using fips fips developed do  work fine anything  perhaps even  however much use older do version since large partition size available since do reported work do   novell do introduction program inspired linux project installing linux pc used do window many people want retain smaller partition do software however since harddisks contain one large partition would normally required complete backup erase partition build two new partition would restore backup one new partition time consuming activity requires lot floppy disk buy  disk backup restore hd fips written remedy problem split partition without losing data provided enough free space new partition end old one fips fips reduces size partition changing value partition table boot sector change formatting partition especially cluster size size file allocation table fat therefore reduced partition fat partly unused problem do free space fips creates new primary do partition want use new partition different o eg linux use supplied fdisk program make necessary change refer o manual want use new partition doswindows use formatting aware following according official reference do one primary partition do version least v happily work multiple primary partition undocumented feature want follow official rule delete new partition fdisk create extended partition place reason multiple primary partition among possibility boot different partition changing active par tition fdisk known problem multiple primary partition accidentally delete one primary partition fdisk easily recreate since fdisk refuse may fdisk program around work else fails boot linux boot disk run linux fdisk always hassle exist software package work partition table may confused multiple primary partition among sfs secure file system peter gutmann think peter made change program accept unusual configuration may exist software package problem safety fips specifically designed provide maximum safety startup check partition table boot sector fat inconsistency find anything suspicious tell error fips proceed possibility write backup copy root bootsector floppy disk proceeding something go wrong may restore program restorrbexe see section entered start cylinder new partition fips check new partition completely empty examining fat old one fips stop calculated new partition table bootsector fips check eventual bug calculation may detected everything ok fips ask permission write new root bootsector restriction fips work hard disk bioses use interrupt h low level harddisk access think true practically pc fips work disk sector size byte seems do prepared deal different sector size far never seen fips split partition bit fat would want split partition le mb would fips split do partition partition table bootsector must conform msdos  convention marked system indicator byte partition table must value bit sector number bit sector number especially split linux partition fips yet work extended do partition support planned long time ca nt say come fips work already four partition since need one free partition entry fips reduce original partition size le cluster would imply rewriting bit fat bit fat start run chkdsk do  scandisk partition want split norton disk doctor something similar may use alter natively make sure remain dead cluster disk prepare bootable floppy disk drive do usually done giving command sys format window nt o may different doubt check manual copy fips file restorrbexe fipsexe errorstxt disk test booting prepared floppy disk read manual ask local guru ca nt boot floppy disk access hard disk booting test giving command dir c see hard disk root directory else fails try using fips booting normally hard disk bit risky sometimes last resort start fips later given opportunity write backup copy root boot sector file drive called rootbootx x stand digit anything go wrong using fips restore original configuration booting floppy running restorrb please note use fips normally necessary may happen one rootboot file written floppy disk restorrb let choose configu ration file restore file restorrb contains original confi guration try confuse version need backup file rootbootx want undo partition split later starting fips must defragment harddisk space used new partition must free aware window swapfile moved defragmentation program must uninstall enhanced part window control panel rein stall using fips use image mirror last sector hard disk contains hidden system file pointer mirror file must delete file using fips recreated next time run mirror attrib r h imageidx attrib r h mirorsavfil root directory delete file fips offer much disk space creation new partition would expect may mean still much data remaining partition consider making new partition smaller deleting data b hidden file space new partition moved defragmentation program make sure program belong file swap file program example ndos possible safely deleted recreated automatically later need arises see manual detail file belongs sort copy protection must uninstall program belongs reinstall repartitioning ca nt give aid really ca nt figure contact directly attention use do version lower do  try move do hidden system file ibmbiocom ibmdoscom something similar end harddisk wo nt boot since file already first sector partition necessary move aware location do partition partition table may change use new partition do extended partition andor two drive mean name partition may change may become e example taken care c always main c still able boot linux user also mean device number do partition linux may change devhda may become devhda existing linux partition change trouble booting need edit etcfstab file mount do partition bootup use stackersuperstordoublespace received report following scheme work stacker may also work program ca nt confirm since nt use program make sure enough space compressed partition split b use checkdisk program come compression software c remove window swapfile one decrease size compressed volume utility come compression software e boot without compression device driver f look directory listing see much space available new partition use fips described compressed volume fragmented fips offer much space new partition shown directory listing would expect happen normally compressed volume one block consecutive sector happens add fol lowing step g remove hidden readonly system attribute compressed volume h defragment partition j reset hidden readonly system attribute compressed volume please let know scheme work include info later release case use risk use o fips known problem o especially dual boot feature partly due fact o dual boot us two copy boot sector one copy changed fips o work properly even taking consideration people reported strange error message o want give fips try make sure save root boot sector floppy disk fips making change fips might work remove dual boot partition use boot bootable do disk run fips make sure make fips save root boot sector floppy reboot check everything ok do boot o installation disk reinstall dual boot necessary boot o look everything work expected  work o complains hardware error something similar use restorrb undo change fips made reboot reinstall dual boot necessary far find o complains since use o rely user report try fips o would like hear information welcome even  worked   work  idea might problem technical information please tell use multitasking o use fips multitasking environment like o desqview window novell task manager linux do emulator system might still write disk fips changed hard disk structure may result corrupting disk necessarily id suppose case would work nevertheless since safety first concern fips would recommend booting do boot disk running fips safe version  added code dave mccaldon detect window desqview thanks dave o novell task manager yet detected remove code detecting linux do emulator caused hangup many machine use ontrack disk manager ontrack disk manager special program used hard disk cylinder installs boot program hard disk root sector us trick make do think disk le cylinder use fips ontrack dis manager must load otdm driver first nt know loaded floppy disk must boot hard disk fips work expected note linux user use scheme create linux partition partitioning information fips modifies level otdm driver access loaded driver since linux use do driver access new partition possibility completely reformat hard disk using fips prepared bootable floppy disk described section boot start fips typing fips do prompt followed enter may exit program time pressing ctrlc fips first try detect o running window desqview complain tell boot floppy disk proceed nevertheless risk see section fips detect hard disk one ask one want work previous release fips failed detect right number hard disk bioses esp gateway pentium machine hope corrected fips fails detect correct number disk please let know meantime may use switch select drive

type fips write change disk exit splitting partition new partition recognized do first reboot make sure disable program write disk configsys autoexecbat rebooting best bet rename two file boot floppy especially disable mirror image rebooting use chkdsk norton disk doctor make sure old smaller partition ok nt find error may reboot normal configsys autoexecbat start program make sure still read data want use new partition do must format multiple partition make sure format right one drive name may changed want use partition linux may change system indicator byte linux fdisk use mkfs want split new
