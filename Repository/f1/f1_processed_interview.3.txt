tom jennings interview  edited jon  one actually edited tomj fidowpscom tom people tracking stuff  little know sound creepy nt want box report hell time walk room tell local machine none anyone goddam business corporate culture invasion real life like top make money think everyone gon na live like jon well living ivory tower live start think environment environment yeah reality local one everyone know like  well nt know everybody j conversation day sandy stone talked ubiquitous computing computer computing invisible omnipresent  alan kay pointed year ago technology get done right nt even see walk room hand flick switch  much thought give stupid light switch hopefully little light come  telephone getting close j even better room walk light switch automatically motion detector yeah j tell fidonet said im sorta ignorant subject  weird point view course designed  february march  tenth year network collection bulletin board loose confederation completely thoroughly utterly decentralized literally top member narrow view particular reality filter time living amongst hierarchy addict fidonet basic element bulletin board fidonet set protocol let bulletin board communicate fidonet started bunch bulletin board running fido software fidonet added later allow pointto point email fido board j start single bb started system writing software phoenix software phoenix technology first employee portable msdos stuff prior rom bios partly based previous work  portable  msdos  msdos installation three day charging exorbitant sum  delivering really good stuff people got money worth got damn fast art totally portable stuff portable attitude toward hardware wrote bulletin board sort based fidonet importantly social mechanism pretty obvious start going social monster almost technical thing original environment bulletin board around quite time got around fido every bulletin board completely different run cantankerous person ran board way saw fit period fidonet fit environment j anarchic environment yes explicitly anarchic people ran reason separated large distance time space remained locallly oriented ran across old interview old documentation   saying  people didnt hear went one ear think oh anarchism mean throwing rock cop well sometimes suppose mostly cop definition j sense bomb throwing anarchist guess sort sense political disorder   specific event san francisco union labor bust blackmail  guy tom mooney bomb planted blame arranged fall tom mooney tossing as jail putting blame squarely anarchist j anarchy sorta bad connotation anarchy unlike many seem want embrace think libertarian philosophy fairly anarchic find widespread throughout net basically handsoff philosophy think people often take seriously like various anarchist camp rule consider personal philosophy political thing nothing partytype politics j becomes overtly political cease anarchy  yeah le nt really care considered politics per se personal interaction treat people treat relation people anarchism  always call paul goodman style principle people work together better cooperating theyre coerced simple nothing goddam party politics treat people work fidonet based explicitly sort laid top lot fido bulletin board let talk straightforward pointtopoint manner j fido board fido time required fairly lowlevel restructuring innards message base stuff fido pretty good bulletin board year though definitely old fashioned nt done revision fido two year j thinking thinking dropping laughter thought fidonet started spring  two system friend john madill within four month twenty fifty  end year approaching next february nine month started growing really fast every single one run somebody reason manner purpose fidonet accommodate nothing unusual one sense computer network essentially run way internet central internet authority go get system internet put online find people help register nic network information center convention handling name j sort ideally cooperative yeah quite cooperative nt really get kicked unless technically screw something massively illegal glaringly obvious likely technical like nt answer mail long time electronic thing like nt start take echomail came done guy named jeff rush dallas way talk among dallas sysops organizing pizza party fully distributed redundant database using fidonet netmail transport record distributed database functionally equivalent usenet gate back forth easily j link fidonet easily internet uucp mail gateway operating set ufgate package  fidonet internet totally different paradigm ip internet stuff fully connected time want connect system finland rub packet come back generally second fidonet stored forward offline processing  j big short  system j wow lot  doubled year  think doubled year doubling every year long time laugh j lot discussion today encryption scheme involved actually yeah use routinely j using pgp yeah fidonet pretty intentionally involved getting pgp ubiquitous first time around  intentionally consciously quick dump  copy week starting monday sure unstoppable spread quickly kind argument whether legal whether going incriminate use pgp traffic network  j would nt criminal issue  people believe kind crazy nonsense j somebody patent algorithm yeah people afraid send pas encrypted data police bust house steal computer kind stuff  fidonet sprung fullyformed seeming nowhere rest computer world people internet access school industry went school got job grew withmaintained internet connectivity  brought sort internethood j think changing bit  oh changing continue change someday incomprehensible way today sort fidonet come direction came  usual white guy could afford computer best tradition radio astronomy least amateur truly amateur network professional  profession    professional  frequently used mean legitimate opposed amateur  j mean  hobbyist  yeah amateur word became disparaging mean actually older sense like radio amateur sense nt money done sake part fidonet member never traditional kind connectivity also nt corporate culture nt computer network culture basically formed dark j speaking word  culture  find within fidonet universe particular set cultural predilection tend general kind group community us fidonet well like thing really subjective yeah seem travel internet fidonet distinct flavor one better tell culturally speaking internet people say  oh flame level fidonet awful  bullshit flame level internet high loftier language five line signature kind crap  sorry better different le alien comfortable  viceversa fidonet side comfortable familiar language used acronym smiley face junk fidonet flavor usual sociological thing people originally populated defined vague common set people come onto self select  oh like  join enhance sort neutral come absorb  know start hanging people pick manner speaking people course utterly opposed want make professional nt care live corner yeah thing common hard time putting finger fiercely independent utterly fiercely independent viciously anticommercialization long history nasty politics really enlightened politics think lot way pragmatic view better view  better meaning functional today world  people nt pay phone bill j people argue ca nt strictly online community others believe feel kind facetoface interaction internet much began become broadly accessible regular people  internet still completely thoroughly inaccessible  sorry simply accessible large amount hardware intimate relationship someone like go school something otherwise paying money  people fall crack  j public access internet yeah terminal u average person could walk figure use le week would surprised still take huge amount specialized knowledge j technical side fairly dense  oh yeah  swtp cpm do hacker hardware hacker fifteen fucking year twenty year unix intimidating arbitrarily difficult use  lot user macho attitude  well plow  whole priesthood nonsense stupid argument whether online culture possible aint gon na get decided either get made nt think online community people nt asking  online community  going business tangible enough really get documented except hindsight look back say  oh yeah people   really nt push came shove nt stay together  j effaustin little selfconscious actually trying communitybuilding try structure online community austin force get thing done various project one thing effrelated group nt art project thing talking people interested realized lot writer artist hungry get online know like using ca nt get access ca nt unless stumble find system give

jack mean entry level lot lower functional hell mean slow second millisecond difference people j link network strictly email stuff file transfer  oh lot file transfer stuff way lot sophisticated ftp stuff user point view thing called sdn software distribution network look like conference file object message file theyre stored redundant manner locally concentrated far away scattered kind nebulous like network thing monthly announcement new file shareware free thing like file attach send message file request file fetch via message fidonet nt problem lot older network seven bit channel crap eight bit channel bit crcs run alien system problem  ascii character set v cyrillic alphabet kinda stuff problem chaotic anywhere else j remote login  system fidonet radically different radio shack color computer cpm machine apple ii giant do machine giant lan unix box running common protocol far broader hardware base even unix box unified operating system set protocol different mailer fidonet

nt real compatibility tcpip layer rock solid thing common rlogin telnet ftp stuff partly user paradigm rather set protocol well fine wonderful love put real crimp style seen os interfaced ftp j nt  oh really nice point click drag kind get annoyed windowing thing prof horrible looking command line thing done appears incompatible paradigm  oh want file  click  gopher say want go nasty work put box screen  good job ed cavazos almostattorney viceprez effaustin show settle listen conversation continues lot fidonet radically different ca nt get people either hear understand going like others intentionally made like others really basic principle seem random intentional  writing writing seven year strictly american anarchist principle based written policy document actually    attempted

implemented node world utterly changed people run like club u white guy computer node level european definitely obviously growing hopped puddle system appearing south america scattered know go  get one get two four start grow naive right middle u learned quickly nt going work corporation grew became c like thing get powerhungry get grabby territory fight fought constituent network  killed gained control copyright trademark fought network instead dying like everyone predicted thrived j fight go fought lawyer proxy vote usual crap goddam hotel san jose final straw  j part corporation well bunch u started  first brainstorming could  deal modem obvious stuff spokesperson fidonet attend ema meeting year represent bulletin board operator fidonet member electronic privacy thing technical trade stuff obvious thing still lacking still need established really early everyone retains control system expected part run one else run simple sound really radical act get across people nt sit butt course usual work sits butt fine fidonet little odd unlike internet domain name system  say  connect toadcom  say  com okay toad  address  go fidonet appears centralized database every system net copy moment megabyte long ascii database  record updated every week contains full physical logical information entire network  phone number system name restriction use protocol supported ascii text like system name city kind junk contains hierarchical addressing scheme network contains lot redundancy j given central authority maintains database local autonomous unit fidonet  first  terminology fidonet pointnode netzone point nt really part fidonet peculiar thing  node basic unit bulletin board mailonly site generally phone number modem net cluster fidos cluster node like san francisco net sfbay net  system node net basic social organizational unit designed small enough comprehend regular old term like know love club kind group  get big tend fragment piece become autonomous unit net

handgenerated necessary node list processor let incorporate private list reply back like one cut network start thinking realize number good bad side effect like real asshole troublemaker nothing like unless somebody come pull gun something kinda hard get someone kicked le public place  well hotel would relatively easy street got ta live neighbor true fidonet learn live neighbor vice versa flaming asshole learn behave well enough utterly censured generally happens  people ignore one guy another fundamentalist christian nut case amusing actually  true bible  believer called prerapture something prerapture network  persecuted side loved mailing everybody gibberish page page gibberish program filter mail say nt wan na see mail address  j bozofilter yeah basically bozofilter weve em long time also another one called bounce  whenever get anything guy bounce back appends bit text say  message refused site soandso back  irritates people work people even crazy one social organism nt really like disliked widely like audience nothing else thats underpinnings  implemented pretty much way explicitly  written policy document since become unreadable  page boilerplate  fidonet flexible technically technological change opportunity come within year half net support  u robotics smartly discovered bulletin board realized way work even though relatively small number bulletin board sysops bulletin board caller look see hardware buy sysop ask  kind modem  oh must pretty good use  bad mouth hundred people usr basically courted fidonet said  want see modem  first modem courier buck new time buck offered deal dollar bargain relatively speaking wanted true flow control symmetrical modem basic command set instant success hst much industry annoyance kludgey proprietary asymmetrical protocol one way baud way  came u worked handshake stuff started changing protocol side fidonet originally based xmodem amazingly similar x packet ack like kermit much efficient kermit much like uucpg windowed  block ack block ack block ack  fine baud baud good asymmetrical modem collapsed another protocol called wazoo around instantly became hot protocol negotiation started session could pick zmodem trademark chuck forseberg fullywindowed screaming fast run ackless could work hell hst way protocol could nt internet protocol uucpg useless word modem useless existing protocol fidonet historically flexible technologywise ed familiar john quarterman seen map fidonet nt seen map fidonet john show later conference talk occasionally republished one article fidonews ago  fidonews weird phenomenon   circulation weekly newsletter tenth year sort go unacknowledged  fidonet giant credibility problem sprang forth fullyformed way outside traditional computer thing work pc radio shack color computer actually turn nice processor run o  run multiusers packaged machine really amazing software fidonews designed  first year metanet discus net discus social end net first issue retired air force colonel something whining military retirement process people instantly said  supposed technical newsletter fidonet   said  bullshit tired techie crap talk phone telephone time gee ive got great new phone got pushbuttons  get bored quickly like radio amateur talking goddam antenna want put stuff j talking lot three four magazine devoted online culture culture matrix focus internet lot wired one mondo real different way boing boing course real different way realized lot article preoccupied carrier technology carrying message much message culture sort culture evolving yeah forget making goddam conduit medium content content come brand new medium fail lot need developed  software suck hardware suck end talking lot yeah point j really fascinating whats either end conduit  yeah telephone proved actually way convey social information emotion telephone worked talk many way say   keyboard many incredibly ingenius smiley face uppercase  cultural information stripped lot simply access gate determine come  pc  j brings conference computer freedom privacy access issue yeah always skeptical largescale network internet nt pretension   world connected  one percent one percent connected barely tool really suck fault author incredible work foundation world hardly accessible everyone world j buy access internet first well  mine get managing small ip cooperative get sort perk salary essentially fulltime job j actually able pick account since way could got first place buying access really technical interest sociopolitical guess  nt really serious problem way thing exist better worse way complicated thing developed little western history timeline take resource effort energy spread eventually get defined along way definitely basic cultural assumption glued base j allows distributed way organizing thing  see ever good telephone nt get much better telephone think position society like bruce said hacker crackdown notice nt one ubiquitous like light switch nt think telephone exciting object j remember single phone house big deal second phone usually line three phone line one dedicated data line dont think know many people nt least two three phone house two consider rarefied  need two line six one point bulletin board data line like oh voice line data line  j prefer asynchronous text swapping sure maybe personal idiosyncrasy seems funny matisse enzer support guy well  problem ca nt quite figure communicate always say  well look nt call talk  always say  wait dont wan na talk wan na text  laughter
