later find chosen modem working perfectly may choose another one many time necessary later customize modem setting well suit purpose last screen installation program provide default directory would like intermail use small nodelist imlist unarchived imnodelist directory would like use fidonet nodelist may later copy nodelist file imnodelist use program xlaxdiff nodediffa difference file xlaxdiff bundled intermail internal serial driver              intermail primarily use internal routine handling serial port internal routine provide full support fifo buffered uart highly optimized usually prove slightly efficient external fossil driver start imexe without first installed fossil intermail use internal serial driver start fossil like x imexe intermail use internal driver unless force nf fossil command line option example im nf case may desirable use external fossil driver multitasking environment like window may mask register uart chip intermail correctly identify chip enable fifo internal serial routine work standard port standard port would like use serial port need use x desqview user may also find one serial port work internal serial routine using x     x external fossil driver loaded via configsys imrunbat batch file install creates running intermail example configsys devicec imxsys e b r installs x serial port eliminates x opening screen lock com port bps set

centrally distributed nodelist phone number nodelist follow format everywhere format includs country code area code extra digit used many country dial longdistance call example number area code canada might look like nodelist  dial number locally would dial  within area local call would dial  number dialed place north america outside area would dialed exactly appears nodelist handle phone number translation intermail us dialing table control file table start word dial end word end install intermail table created automatically handle call area code may wish improve handle nonlocal call within area code original table may look like dial    long distance within area  local call   within u canada end format rest table first specify part phone number want translate wish replace example  would abbreviated  part number deleted second parameter line left empty example table could improved adding exchange area code local call wherever intermail located     note change dialing table requires recompile nodelist take effect cost table used inform intermail cost per minute area likely dial table start word cost end word end format similar dialing table cost  local call  new york  united
