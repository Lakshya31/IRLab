friend let shoot bull awhile  making successful massacre involves following good gun powerful large quantity ammunition good shooting technique element suprise attack inability victim escape confined area good mental state gunman attack poorly defended location single clearcut goal opinion basic checklist ingredient needed successful massacre course guarentees  hell might invade nunnery one sister might loaded automatic underneath habit blow away even start massacre nature massmurder involves possibility risk failure follows simply thought maximize body count minimize risk failure begin gun ammunition following absolutely business used massacre attempt     caliber gun revolver semiautomatic magazine capacity le round look know one bullet kill one person assuming head heart shot made however massacre controlled situation need use ammunition sufficent power cause death without necessitating perfectly placed shot addition need large quantity ammunition short period time thus  minor  caliber gun revolver likewise eliminated   caliber magnum revolver quite decent something like assination attempt serial killing place massacre massacre balance must reached need destructive power need large amount ammunition accessible ready fired immediately leaf semiautomatic fullautomatics fully automatic best difficult accquire book describe convert semiauto rifle fire fully automatic personally feel unless experienced machinist gunsmith risk attempting successful conversion outweigh benefit fullauto firepower semiautomatic either rifle pistol get job done slightly le successfully fullauto conserative number quite easy operate semi even faster practice massacre taking general aim without sighting one target one round easily fired every two second choose sight target one shot every three second releasing empty magazine inserting fully loaded one cycling round chamber easily done five seven second using figure obvious time span five minute equal second round ammunition easily fired number could approach two hundred gunman familiar weapon practiced speed shooting firing range prior massacre attempt caliber ammunition best personal choice mm nine millimeter round besides mm also like  winchester   acp said earlier balance powerful ammo need large amount ammo vital tipping scale far either direction could limit kill count like mm  speciality  round bullet cost around  going massacre see money viable consideration  glaser safety slug  mm bullet loaded  tiny pellet guage shot explodes upon impact target  multiple projectile cartridge  actually seperates two bullet fired gun make contact target thus every round fired two seperate bullet entry wound created  inch apart anyone looking maximize kill count consider  buckabullet  round important point must made many gun even brandnew one feed certain bullet type reliably example many mm gun feed heavy full metal jacket bullet perfectly use lightweight hollowpoint occassional  failure feed  middle massacre last thing need something like happen practice shooting using exact ammunition plan use massacre ever experience even one failure feed  stovepipe jam  using particular ammunition never consider using ammo massacre consider gun modified feed particular ammo feel best massacre gunsmith bring gun box ammo gunsmith  customize  gun feed ammo perfectly another thing gunsmith replace gun standard  magazine release button  extralarge quicker releasing one offer small possibly significant advantage massacretype situation gunman must release empty magazine many time replace fully loaded one extralarge button make action quicker fumblefree especially since midst massacre stressful time gunman let talk magazine since gunman easily fire  round fiveminute time span fairly obvious one never much ammunition hand anyone undertakes massacre le round hand limiting may never get chance shoot half need never hurt le needed hurt plenty personally would take onethousand round  yes heavy especially carry person hey nobody ever said massacre easy want easy commit suicide successful massacre take dedication planning effort determination  money need magazine lot em problem term acquiring gun dealer order direct factory gun made number magazine question asked example gun us round magazine need order thirtythree mag yes fully load round ammunition set massacre give round immediate disposal massacre obviously semiauto accepts smaller larger magazine need adjust number magazine needed accordingly must magazine fully loaded begin massacre order maximize kill count foolish plan taking  timeout  massacre reload empty magazine take second release empty magazine insert new fully loaded one actually load empty round magazine would take two minute totally unacceptable massmurder situation semiauto pistol us round magazine job little slower semiauto rifle us round mag long start fully loaded mag lot round semiautomatic pistol good enough obviously rifle would better advantage would quite small opinion anyone undertakes massacre carrying one firearm fool gun jam gun malfunction one fails shot people massacre  shot hell  pun intended unless clear malfunction whole thing must carry minimum two gun possible identical exact make model reason important magazine gun identical magazine carrying function either gun big advantage say better carry two gun identical carry five gun use different mag odds two gun malfunctioning time small obviously get three gun make model better two however anything three gun overkill pun intended much better carry extra magazine carry extra gun three gun enough carrying slow could limit number magazine carry case bullet important gun move new topic  good shooting technique  good shooting technique massmurder situation different shooting situation accuracy important making every shot count important conserving ammunition important  one shotone kill  important avoiding hitting innocent bystander importance tell important vital get people ground start massacre escape try wrestle weapon away start massacre never aim anyone head shoot wide arc covering target aim midsection body hit people lower chest stomach groin upper thigh area  midsection effective type fire start mass killing wound caused midsection put injured ground fatality goal first barrage gunfire goal immobilize people position unchallenged anyone even people hit gunfire likely shock blood pouring friendsrelativescoworkers etc  initial barrage gunfire probably  round worth fired deliberately sight wounded finish one four five shot chest area  hit chest area fatality rate since chest area bigger head would aim chest however visual feast seeing  brain getting blown  important consideration experienced target shooter good eyesight good eyesight choose concentrate head face shot rather chest fatality rate good better exciting visual situation however experienced shooting gun suggest sticking chest area maximize kill count one important point massacre take place situation one people involved attempt resist encourage people resist viewed  authority figure  member group plan massacre must repeat must kill person first shoot time mutilate body gunfire crucial must assume complete control group start massacre let explain fact lone gunman  let say  fifty people fifty people unarmed even easily rush disarm  leader  someone give order respected viewed  authority figure  others group type situation virtually never occurs people shock frightened think anything except begging mercy praying god hugging wounded friend etc  leader group people dangerous must single kill first kill people immediately abandon thought overpowering sheer number way spot  authority figure  locate source loudest coherant word andor shouting instruction nobody ever expects massacre definately total confusion shooting begin indeed  authority figure  present person likely attempt give  order  shouting thing like  run nearest exit   nt panic people   rush grab gun  etc  job mass killer locate person whose voice hear everyone else cry praying screaming incoherantly locate  authority figure  concentrate gunfire anyone around shouting instruction stop  leader  likely dead resume sweeping entire area closing say absolutely excuse large number wounded people survive shoot person anywhere even arm leg person likely ground easy target finish burst gunfire head chest fatality count wounded eventually recover nt ever stingy ammunition like said carry round minimum someone lying ground see moving arm leg shoot area see body jerk recognize hit continue sweep entire room nt spend much time one person keep mind long someone moving still alive assume bleed death  finish job personally view patrick purdy stockton california schoolyard shooting spree horrible failure term body count fired approx shot hit people killed five people point view hard believe people little child hit gunfire purdy finish job ground  failed finish marc lepine hand shot total people fourteen died obviously much impressive purdy half lepine shot actually died fatally shot shot survived personally feel massacre half shot survive wound must considered failure least point essay let emphasize essay deal one particular aspect massmurder obtain maximum body count saying best proper way massmurder  argue anyone say  courageous  massmurder police station rather schoolyard  entire focus essay centered one goal max death ok let u briefly examine  element suprise attack  importance massmurder think crucial element fact every massmurder total suprise nobody ever predict certain person attempt massshooting particular day particular place precaution gunman need take involves simple common sense write threatening letter indicate planning massacre particular location fool driving towards place plan masskilling get car block away walk final block rifle clearly visible everyone street fool sure get point serious use ordinary common sense approach  element suprise attack  successful next point  picking poorly defended place attack  bit complicated obviously maximize body count attack police station may kill pig since abundance firearm eventually pig shoot knocking idea damn decent  wish achieve maximum body count wrong way go fact lot ordinary people gun selfprotection purpose anytime attempt massmurder run risk ordinary citizen pulling gun shooting happen situation although thing increase likelihood massacre attempt truly large wideopen area amusement park stadium movie theatre etc involves considerably high risk one place least risk school large number people kill minimal risk returnfire another ideal situation one gunman familiar people killing example man throw big party close  friend  relative case know near certainty none people carry gun thus virtually risk returnfire another useful tool certain situation frisking people weapon applicable many situation due time factor gunman enters confined area suspicion aroused anyone outside could produce weapon point people order put hand head perform frisk person open fire begin massacre complete confidence knowing none victim armed one thing certain attempt massmurder risk life process must willing die mean commit suicide end massacre force gun battle police arrive scene choose option respect would either two thing hate hate people hate society general may willing die hell must willing die attempt masskilling  mean however eager die  death wish  let u move merrily along  inability victim escape confined area  rather important something sometimes overlooked massmurder happen open area stadium concert etc  prowling street  witness howard unruh killed people one day prowling street camden new jersey back  however entrapping containing group people confined area would seem best way maximize kill count gunman plan attack certain building house room attempt familiarize layout structure basic question must many exit outside structure many particular room lead need take account fact every individual room could used confined area building one exit even private house front back exit think mind consequence serious must know exit located order plan attack building plan attack small one people chosen kill inside must find way seal exit except one enter hand building large particular victim mind may necessary seal outside exit create  confined area  individual room room one door leading hallway exit room onto street hallway one door cinch block door presence massacre people room room window need consider possible method escape another useful detail whether door open inside outward outside inward let give example ideal massacre situation large room full people located large building window room one door leading hallway door open outside inward meaning someone hallway would push door forward enter room scenario would ideal massacre massmurderer heaven say hell course necessary  perfect  type situation order successful massacre  type building room turned  confined area  long gunman familiar layout blocking building exit prior massacre use large bottle gasoline setting fire front exit one possibility next item  good mental state
