advisory call unsure reverse dialling worry much basically mean person answering advisory call hear data tone thus implying advisory call progress without reverse dialling mode person answering call would hear nothing may assume telecommunication error occurred modem may support ringback option one usually command sequence r invoke option consult modem manual reference case reverse ringback string r eg forward slash reverse dialling command option therefore set particular modem command consult modem manual hayes command set defines ringback command single r probably change comcalls

eg comcall used invoke package sometimes desirable automated reboot option comcall may reinitialised via autoexecbat file comcall provides option use comboot x option may executed do prompt within bat

affecting request unless execute comboots request see similarily comboot would result immediate reboot occuring reboot option result terminate stay resident tsr installed circumstance application may contend tsr always check set ups thoroughly relying upon example found invoke window win following setting reboot request reboot time action performed windowns stopped return do prompt way around create batch file bat call another boot request eg cd comcall comboot reboot min within window cd window win start window comboot reboot immediate request warning comboot invoke cold reboot matter usually described bad practice state machine time reboot request unknown resembles power failure file may open io may occuring time reboot thus affected reboot treat reboot command similar effect powering offon pc wo nt go far wrong decide use reboot option treat command respect comboots command stop reboot request reboot comboot invoked either bat file do prompt wish abort auto reboot use comboots command do prompt within bat file useful comcall may driven bat file invokes comms package awaiting return call data mode reboot request contained within bat file order reset system back comcall recall within time period x minute call back data mode would execute comboots command upon establishing data link stop reboot comcall command execute comcall entering comcall alone do prompt automatically taken main comcall process initially see couple time delayed introductory screen thereafter presented session configuration screen time modify save applied future usage comcall time may modified entry configuration screen autoentry delay count second pressing esc key bypass delay key pressed within time main comcall process entered delayed auto entry enables comcall used batch file processing eg bat file known default session option already set suitable value comcall session two trigger option available may therefore define separate action taken two separate trigger condition ring range option may modified comcall entry option lower upper ring count ring count lowerupper set range full ring wish comcall trigger action upon receipt value may identical stipulate exact number ring trigger minimum number ring may specified maximum upper level ring range ring count value considered inclusive lap range option trigger action option full ring varies country country example uk brrrbrrrr ring comcall take part full ring worth noting country ring heard caller ring heard called person may phase comcall responds actual ring received locally comcalls ring counter increment modem detects ring lead case say caller hears one ring cycle whereas receiving end two ring cycle could occurred critical operation therefore recommended select ring trigger range number ring cycle wish trigger remotely select mid ring count two value making trigger call executetelephoneexit etx option parameter set according required trigger action eg telephone advisory call made number defined commandtelephone option see later e option enables command defined commandtelephone option performed trigger condition satisfied do command program filename may called even call bat file required together parameter required called program upper limit parameter may passed x option used desired use comcall bat file case using e option prevent successful reload comcall eg trigger condition met

selected command action do command program filename filename full filename etc comcallexe four parameter may included command eg echo hello x command action selected numeric value greater one le desired exit errorlevel set information bat file processing errorlevel value consult operating system manual option telephone may able define delay period including additional character string consult yur modem manual example advisory call made automatic switchboard eg requiring prefix digit dialled followed short delay use delay character cater let say delay charater comma number gaining external line wish call number  telephone command line value would  include dash telephone number command action receiving trigger condition comcall instruct modem dial digit followed short delay followed number delay character vary modem modem consult modem manual advise case may wish concatenate number delay usually achieved using two delay character consecutively eg  using comcall comcall work pc modem must left power loss system result loss comcall monitoring ensure power glitch could copy comcall command last line autoexecbat file power fail restored pc would reboot reexecute comcall command
