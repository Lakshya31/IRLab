pyrotxt star flare color mixture part series file pyrotechnic explosive serious stuff really dangerous nt treat seriously kid watch many cartoon remember part body get blown away real world stay blown away cant treat stuff respect nt screw around file start set safety rule nt skip read em memorize em beginning set general rule always apply thing know material using making time read thoroughly starting anything pyrotechnic preparation explosive nature unstable subject ignition explosion heat shock friction clear understanding dangerous property due care handling ingredient finished product necessary accident avoided always observe possible precaution particularly following mix small batch one time mean gram ounce nt go big mix  make bigger accident power explosive cube every ounce ounce time powerful one ounce weighing chemical use clean piece paper scale pan item discard used paper bucket water weighing next ingredient safe worker dispose chemical spilled workbench equipment weighing nt keep open container chemical table since accidental spillage mixing may occur finished container close replace storage shelf use clean equipment chemical ground grind separately never together thoroughly wash clean equipment grinding another ingredient mixing batch done outdoors away flammable structure building barn garage etc mix also made non metallic container avoid spark glass also used since shatter case accident handy small container made cutting top plastic bottle three four inch bottom mix may conveniently made placing ingredient plastic bottle rolling around mixture uniform case point open end container away never hold body face container stirring done wooden paddle stick avoid spark static powdered ground material may also mixed placing large sheet paper flat surface rolling across sheet lifting side corner one time never ram tamp mix paper cardboard tube pour material gently tap shake tube settle content store ingredient finished mix fire hazard away heat flame finished preparation may stored plastic bottle shatter case accident since many ingredient mix poisonous stored reach child pet preferably locked away sure thread screw top container cap thoroughly cleaned applies also container stopper rubber cork type closure trace mixture caught container closure may ignited friction opening closing container throughout procedure work clean condition always wear face shield least shatterproof safety glass careful worker handling dangerous material sure lens frame flammable always wear dust respirator handling chemical dust form small particle gather lung stay may cause serious illness later life always wear glove working chemical always wear waterproof lab apron must work indoors good ventilation system never smoke anywhere near working make sure open flame present motor produce spark inside hot water heater furnace pilot light stove spark known readily explode dust floating air always work someone two head better one source water readily available fire extinguisher hose etc never circumstance use metal load chemical put chemical firework metal casing worse handle live hand grenade never use metal container includes dangerous co cartridge many people killed flying fragment metal casing please use metal circumstance always thoroughly familiar chemical using information included file look whatever extra information material thought safe later found dangerous stuff wash hand face thoroughly using chemical nt forget wash ear nose device built fails work leave alone half hour may try bury never try unload reuse dud dust particle start form air stop leave settle read entire file trying anything never strike mixture containing chlorate nitrate perchlorate permanganate bichromate powdered metal nt drop even handle

oxidizer decomposes degree well known component gunpowder also used firework piece available white powder potassium perchlorate kclo much stable chlorate brother chemical white slightly pink powder often substitute potassium chlorate make mixture safer yield oxygen easily make give oxygen also poisonous red gum rosin similar shellac often replace many firework formula red gum obtained bark tree shellac powder organic rosin made secretion insect live india exact effect produce firework obtainable gum common mixture shellac alcohol sold hardware store avoided purchase powdered variety orange

chemical rule go mixture contain oxidizing agent usually produce oxygen used burn mixture reducing agent burn produce hot gas addition coloring agent impart color fire binder hold mixture solid lump regulator speed slow speed mixture burn possibility cover case oxidizing agent nitrate chlorate perchlorate provide oxygen usually consist metal ion actual oxidizing radical example potassium nitrate contains metal ion potassium oxidizing radical nitrate instead potassium could instead substitute metal like sodium barium strontium chemical would still supply oxygen burning mixture le desirable sodium nitrate example absorb moisture air make harder control speed mixture burn following example use letter  x  show presence generic metal ion note nitrate stingy oxygen give give one third nitrate nitrite oxygen xno  xn chlorate generous hand give oxygen furthermore give easily take le heat le shock get oxygen loose mixture using chlorate burn spectacularly smaller volume mix need wasted oxidizer ease oxygen supplied make burn faster mixture also much sensitive shock chlorate chloride oxygen xclo  xcl perchlorate round usual set oxidizing tool perchlorate contain even oxygen chlorate also give however sensitive chlorate make mixture  safer  le likely explode drop strike perchlorate chloride oxygen xclo  xcl reducing agent like sulfur charcoal carbon simply burn oxygen produce sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide usually best include mixture two pyrotechnic mixture burn different speed temperature proper combination help control speed combustion also extra fast burning speed needed like rocket firecracker metal powder often added finer powder faster burning rate proportion change speed well magnesium powder dust often used speed aluminum dust work well zinc dust used case powdered metal dust particularly aluminum iron often used produce mixtire shoot spark burn rare case desirable slow burning speed case corn meal often used burn act reducing agent nt burn well coloring agent interesting long known various metal produce different colored flame burned fire reason buried realm quantum physic result matter present note use oxidizing agent contains colorizing metal double job produce oxygen color barium barium salt give pleasant green color barium nitrate often used strontium strontium salt give strong red color strontium nitrate convenient material red sodium sodium salt give intense yellow color intense fact sodium compound mixture usually wash colorizers said sodium nitrate absorbs moisture air really suitable impart color instead sodium oxalate usually used absorb lot water disadvantage poisonous copper copper salt used give blue color blue difficult color produce usually spectacular usually copper acetoarsenite paris green used compound contains arsenic poisonous since still nt produce memorable blue often used mercurous chloride enhances color also poisonous expensive boot potassium potassium salt give delicate purple
