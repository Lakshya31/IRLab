bombtxt instruction making  remington magnumsized bomb following instruction lead step necessary manufacture small pyrotechnic device device toy extremely dangerous manufacture use furthermore many law book federal state level make manufacture device felony many law also cover intent manufacture device making felony well therefore material presented show possible simple material little bit time actually make device said let get brass tack involved first list toolscontainers hot glue gun around  hardware store powder measure calibrated black powder volume powder funnel load powder measure wire cutter scissors wire cutter work best machine shop goggles wraparound type ceramic coffee cup clean dry materialssupplies  remington magnum brass spent primer still place pyrodex p powder black powder recommended hot glue stick green cannon hobby fuze x index card hot glue testing paint spray paint optional setup preparation put safety glass never handle explosive explosive component without first protecting eye modern machineshop quality goggles amazing protective capability used properly would able read screen today regularly worn thing messing explosive also nice fresh clean clear unsmoked goggles let really see easily extinguish cigarette open flame candle stove proceeding really important lay clean work area covered sheet newspaper something else old sheet protect surface working plug hot glue gun place somewhere safe warms brass casing primer installed necessary first squirt small droplet hot glue hole primer normally seat make sure primer hole completely sealed powder spill device remain watertight brass case reasonably clean leftover powder residue normal firing gun usually problem excessive contaminant gun grease dirt may adversely affect quality product making pour approximately  cup gun powder coffee cup enough make lot little device put away rest powder closing cap storing away work area keep amount exposed powder lying around small possible case kind accidental ignition initial testing adjustment important ensure hot glue gun hot powder using take small amount powder pinch put small pile index card middle work area temporarily put away coffee cup extra powder case glue gun set small pile powder glue gun reached full operating temperature approximately  minute place hot nozzle powder hold full minute two nothing happens carefully squirt blob hot glue onto small pile powder using back metal spoon press melted hot glue firmly powder hear individual grain powder crunching mixing glue long ignition never seen pyrodex ignite like black powder might prone detonation glue gun safe use wait glue spoon cool scrape blob knife flushing toilet otherwise wetting disposal adjust powder load set powder measure approximately  grain volume cva powder measure load single casing powder case approximately  full powder cause explosive force decrease seal casing effectively adjust setting powder measure obtain approximate  fill capacity case using find dotted crimp around case mark seating point bullet good level fill adjusted measure desired fill level lock measure set screw pour powder back coffee cup powder setting adjusted properly glue gun warm work area clean neat time begin production production lay five brass case base open end using wire cutter snip five section fuze wire approximately  long work five case time give best rate speed keep clutter minimum work area feel unsure unhandy start working single casing time first work  mass production  load case measured powder charge setting carefully back spill powder set case far enough apart pick one individually without fear knocking others one time fuze seal casing critical techniqueoriented part procedure want good solid glue plug installed plus fuze must reach way glue plug make solid contact charge experiment technique come whatever method result consistent load put one end section fuze firmly powder press powder least  inch even way powder bump base casing put nozzle glue gun open end case pushing fuze aside gently slowly squirt molten glue casing begin slowly turning case finger pushing fuze around spread glue evenly onto loose powder around fuze twirl case fast drag glue blob around disturb powder charge case fill molten glue retract nozzle continue rotating case filling slightly full amount extra glue experimented typically sucked back case next step put glue gun holding case one hand fuze slowly twist fuze circle swirling stillmelted glue around allowing settle powder pull fuze keep fuze pressed firmly powder twist procedure also  burp  case bringing extra air might got trapped glue powder surface within twist may see bubble appear keep twisting pressing fuze bubble surface pop extra glue come may need add another tiny blob glue bring top glue level case rim case completed set aside cool placing case front desk fan nt put fan anywhere near handling loose powder help cooling process significantly final production made device chance cool completely may proceed painting stage skip entirely discretion painting device make look lot cooler mention giving le sinister appearance bunch brass case fuze sticking preferred method painting dip device thick onecoat enamel paint usually white light gray set foilcovered plastic fastfood tray wait one hour paint get slightly tacky excess run pool around device hour transfer

take mind paint bright firecracker red know exactly fun cleanup put away unused powder coffee cup mop spilled powder wet paper towel  use vacuum cleaner electric motor make spark ignition use little device really quite small see end able load fun around camping trip th july new year holiday boating trip general pranking around however remember since case made metal brass fly speed sufficient cause bodily injury death dont try hold one thing hand light always make sure clear area hiding behind something solid device go interesting feature device made properly employ goodquality waterproof green fuze wire may tossed water lit try swimming pool even ocean make sure core fuze properly burning tell sparkling happens core burn fling device water make impressive  thump  sound water shallow enough inch may even get plume water spraying air throwing device deep swimming pool standing next watching go probably safest way set actually watch action safety consideration know working metalcased explosive metal case fragment fly even small particle considerable harm entire base  remington magnum cartridge almost guaranteed remain intact upon detonation eject  backwards  velocity approaching handgun round break glass go piece wood go clothing rip open skin etc also ricochet hard surface continue redirected path destruction safe noisemaking fun like around th july device best entire case buried top case little way ground grip upper part case fuze come press firmly soft soil bury sand tends contain shrapnel guarantee however since sometimes depending good glue seal top part device brass glue plug blow fly rapidly get way sort thing particularly recommended practice far safety go one also launch device slingshot put device pouch either light difficult ask friend light soon fuze catch fire slingshot send flying wait time fuze right burst high air cause far significant sound  footprint  ie people hear
