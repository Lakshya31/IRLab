pulled could placed inside large charge sensitive high explosive tear gas another material might well useful sociopath material could instantly disseminated large crowd mean rocketbomb nasty effect  smoke bomb one type pyrotechnic device might employed terrorist many way would smoke bomb device could conceal getaway route cause diversion simply provide cover device produce enough smoke smelled bad enough could force evacuation building example smoke bomb difficult make although military smoke bomb employ powdered white phosphorus titanium compound material usually unavailable even wellequipped terrorist instead heshe would make smoke bomb homemade smoke bomb usually employ type base powder black powder pyrodex support combustion base material burn well provide heat cause material device burn completely cleanly table sugar mixed sulfur base material produce large amount smoke sawdust especially small amount oil base powder work well also excellent smoke ingredient small piece rubber finely ground plastic many chemical mixture material road flare mixed sugar sulfur base powder produce much smoke fueloxodizer mixture ratio correct produce much smoke added base powder list possibility go trick successful smoke bomb also lie container used plastic cylinder work well contributes smoke produced hole smoke bomb fuse enters must large enough allow material burn without causing explosion another plus plastic container since melt burn smoke material ignites producing opening large enough prevent explosion  colored flame colored flame often used signaling
