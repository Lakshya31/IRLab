setting much better quality st edition designer learned put relevant material box rather think interesting really nd edition think improvement rule overall cost far much justify buying stuff group still using st edition  home rule  change mixed nd edition thing liked good revision ad oversight unnecessary material basic rule got point got nostalgia truthfully think never published core rule well core rule quite essential definitely spectacular anything many improvement original rule annoying thing comment need seperate player dm book rpgs nt need champion good example  one book system  perhaps tsr spend time facilitating storytelling instead burdening system rule bright enough add bell whistle nt time create gaming system ground much second edition fan use part like  though  group play still us mostly st edition use nd edition mostly nonweapon proficiency typo removed would excellent purchase generally consolidation information quite good explanation clear concise need player handbook nd ed dungeon master guide play game beginning learned system always improvise almost never use l l tom boa player handbook         far best book tsr published certain ambiguity like thief able backstab weapon wield missile attack tend mess thing phb well organized complete worth money buy problem rule unclear aimed much younger audience nd edition phb much better first edition second edition phb vast vast improvement original clear concise rule intelligent reworking gygax infinite table personal favourite thac system much better attack matrix two minor beef rule illusion magic scattered two three place book system silly four die roll determine whether orcs believe giant boulder rolling towards please well written coherent huge improvement first edition phb contained good stuff like revised proficiency list bad stuff  cheesy secondary skill list absolutely hated complete friendlier st edition though first run copy error nt help plus binding nt good st edition book criticm levelled nd edition book general need somewhere start good one later version missed problem earlier printing folk rating mistake might differ mine useful although directed younger audience st edition annoying error ambiguity player handbook okay rule blew chunk stripped lot could make money supplement think player handbook messy info organized table one place example want know daily movement rate must scan lot text order find fact price one organized ed vital combat rule present ranger bit weak compared paladin especially xp illusionist castrated ed losing special prerogative powerful illusion like specialist eg diviner weak adventuring situation limited specialist spell eg necromancer new bard good question bard would likely climb wall say move silently good job unmunchkinning unearthed arcanum rule worst problem player handbook give much information player information nt simple starting player know much spell undead creature phb clear lot ambiguity st edition honest exception thief like way revised class phb essential never going dm really book need got always way improve thing phb course absolutely essential playing game player handbook essential first book even supplement still contains essential information leaf le important stuff exception nonweapon proficiency become significant game nd ed first published played lot different role playing system say player handbook easiest book use playing year two orginization lacking say least book heralded whole new look style complete revamping rule ad showed gloss sharp layout set standard rpgs far easier read comprehend contained everything player needed begin play basic level featured new art reason nt given quality material editing problem book reprinted several time time minor correction also first printing done cheap cover binding fell apart quickly recent printing durable stock taken printing hardbounds way well certainly better written almost every book though beginning kind stupid also wish later chapter time movement vision light clearer nt many  see dmg  bit surely tsr correct flashy new release dungeon master guide            think actually st edition dm guide good perhaps better course nd edition guide much smooth efficent major mistake nd edition version nt list monster hp like original  mistake  although chart table pretty good although edition dm guide dosnt tell newbie dm dm well dmg contains useful information waffle many thing nt clarify lot personally run game without one nd edition dmg ca nt even compare first edition went wealth information dearth dmg fairly good severely lacking information compared first edition organization almost make loss find dmg slightly le necessary phb find referencing far le often nowhere near complete st edition dmg missing nifty little cartoon might user friendly somehow feel getting ripped dmg shrink much many gygax sillier idea better forgotten random creation dungeon ick reprint player handbook plus thing needed forced buy damn thing although dm guide improved st edition miscellaneous table could left happened information nothing worth since moved chart table combat phb well book pretty pointless nothing new original dmg lot lost dmg bit general need exact info also lack complex table ph thin biggest problem lack advice campaigning adjucating highlevel situation need rule developing spell magical item also seems ridiculous book nt include least firstlevel adventure half dmg ph nt even give advice new dm use dmg magical item dmg contains little information value period experienced dm thought nt need dmg much right dm guide also still appropriately titled considering content necessary dm necessary consult player giving dm book good idea kind stuff put stuff player handbook whereas dmg first edition provided everything dungeonmaster needed run game second edition seemed strip lot meat dmg became basically handbook rule experience magic item creation treasure magic item description odds end spellcasting combat movement thrown filler instead producing definitive dungeonmaster guide tsr threw thing subsequently published castle guide sourcebook catacomb dungeonmaster handbook would gladly paid buck comprehensive dmg x thick wimpy thing came dungeon master guide lost lot since st ed recently bought st ed dmg pretty shocked see big compared nd ed one say big mean big idea great regard nd ed one fairly skimpy hence low score  great always wondered cheap make make one chbs  hardbind chb together take crappy part sell monstrous manual         monstrous manual good common animal lack illustration text detail annoying meaning still necessary compendium also quite illustration recycled black white artwork show great art work liked binder better  could pick monster wanted save time fumbling book looking info needed another ploy make u spend money stuff already could nt tsr put book first place aargh tsr make mind mc okay concept though lacking overall index section one matter back ol mm wait ff mmii reappear monster specifically ravenloft another world one common book never much prefer hardbound version looseleaf short bought monstrous compendium great many believed product tsr ditched monstrous manual useful book dm  monster normally use never really needed compendium  monstrous manual get high point toni diterlizzi fabulous art one thorough still compact monster guide game monstrous manual beautiful product best lot complete summary fabulous art monstrous manual came still stuck good ol st edition mm mm except product far better original mc still lacking character inspirational quality original monster manual tsr hit new low put monstrous compendium crap switch back hard cover rehash stuff make look like something new low redeeming value useful nt blow cash mc mm lack rolling chart random encounter therefore get low score must good description ecology habit nt one colour art seems nice fine book fine price essential ad supplement monstrous manual hardcover nd edition excellent especially new color art monstrous manual use travel preferred looseleaf format monster perfect binding bunch monster described yet hell go buy monstrous compendium completly change format complete garbage nt fact style ease use original would scored much lower liked whole monstrous compendium thing resent fact abandoned without even acknowledgement however monstrous manual basically revamping original monster manual excellent resource game play monster would normally need within one hardbound illustration color use basic monster normal play none speciality  baddie npc much versatile unpredictable see orc generally know getting encounter another nondescript man dwarf elf halfling etc could death incarnate drunken bum peasant interest threat player player know made attempt communication colour monstrous manual great addition help accurate description well helping miniature painting bad bad still perfect nt really think long   monstrous  monstrous manual good color picture almost monster although best invisible stalker however much information shortened fit one page legend lore        missing nonhuman deity xps defeating avatar use st edition version instead legend lore useful use god campaign different area northern etc different myth good correspond complete priest hb regard sphere granted power etc work good base making priestclasses thank god took away stats god always bothered st edition deity demigod book gave stats god player could go kill god stats ca nt kill em damn let player crack avatar want deicide annoyed see babylonian finnish mythos excluded nd edition book though dislike whole idea giving divine being stats munchkins beat legend lore essential especially complete priest handbook legend lore interesting book read found power given specialty cleric unbalancing game situation nd edition legend lore definetely improves god st edition neccessity playing sad  plain sad mythology abomination book took lot good st  become god  part priesthood good especially use tom sphere allowance published dragon magazine however probably book would useful one dm except inspiration granted

new spell need anyway tome magic imo totally useless nt need spell give definite feeling outside job doesnt ad look feel quite okay job filling nook cranny new spell wizard seem focus offbeat useful add immensely mages cleric fill glaring gap priest spell faith magic cooperative magic quest spell love wild mages new priest spell find using mage spell slightly le often magic item rarely good point  wild magic bad point  give cleric much power unless strict dm sorta like st edition ua minus munchkin class woulda liked research side magic love addition wild mages tome elementalists wizard also pretty good problem book magic item either way lame powerful mostly quest spell pretty useless give dm giving age usually form object perform spell certain time lot better nt try introduce many useless sphere thanks dragon magazine realigning sphere specific god tome magic excellent tsr bothered using new sphere introduced later product tome magic great magic supplement tome magic new spell otherwise nt care add wild magic campaign also elementalists good extension spell mages quite impressive new sphere allow specialist priest finally power denied cleric without carboncopying druid new spell interesting magic item section rather weak one would buy world designer nt put new schoolsspheres world low quality commercial trick book read really useful except tome magic tom opinion could better filled spell item seemed extra spell put fill space like wild mage elementalist mage class however tome magic added considerably friend campaign excellent artwork tome magic way cool many useless next useless spell think cool people want new killer spell think boring tome magic interesting useful idea spell toy good idea think come tome magic excellent longneeded expansion ad magic rule priest long neglected shown poor priest handbook tsr book increased spell list cleric still far outweighed numerous spell published mages nice chunk added speres also enabled customizing original pantheon thereby power individual pc priest new spell mages along rule wild magic elementalist magic brought source  nothing new also helpful expanded existing class tom waste shelf space nt really see use buying book seems like designed fill space good spell making wizard repetoire complex wild mage elementalist worthless imho tome magic book artifact put phb dmg hard tsr combine book artifact         book artifact nice rule magic item creation preposterous mage right mind would spend time trying make le useful magic item reason book artifact neat little would actually use magic item creation stuff invaluable though purchased book artifact look particularly good would fun resource basically ok contains longmissed guideline making magical item thought artifact neat stuff quite useless yet another example stuff dmg tsr saved make money beyond nt bad old dmg already knew stuff information back boa make magical item excellent add good amount detail designing recharging magical item artifact secondary importance like artifact writeups expand well material old dmg even book small portion book useful one dm one highlight large number low powered artifact suitable level  give material creating campaign much interesting story mech expensive book artifact pretty useless basically story necessary heck crap hell would give artifact pc way campaign pc could artifact without incuring wrath deity two hunted npc far concerned ridiculous thing tsr ever published artifact impressed offering basically took old artifact old much better dmg fancied presentation go magical research possible creation artifact supposed complete wizard handbook nt buy snazzy book wellpresented etc dm probably never get freaking thing recommended  end
