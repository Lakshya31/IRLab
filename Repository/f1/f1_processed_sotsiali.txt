come contact u however time firmly convinced serious devoted study ufo broaden horizon knowledge nature opinion scientist subject khodyrev moscow sensation convinced way meeting doctor chemical science professor dmitriyev institute general communal hygiene im n sysin however scientist chose begin conversation precisely sensation pertaining still nlo ufo unidentified flying object reached foreign magazine published russian language showed following report according story certain farmer travelling forest cart saw two individual walking meter half height dressed narrow black tightfitting overall resembling astronaut suit face hand green striking feature individual elongated eye somewhat side face sharp cheekbone jumped cart several dozen meter motioned farmer stop far machine suspended  ground ordered gesture undress done  examined   photographed  certain camera looked like two saucer motioned free go returned home farmer told relative happened villager arrived spot saw trampled grass print strange footware sign seemed support someone indeed time distance meter clearing sixyear old boy playing yard saw told strange  airplane  flying low ground pilot green face author report scientist writes eyewitness examined medically even psygalvanometer used  sensitive part lie detector  conclusion   possibility encounter ufo matter strange may seem discounted   think  asked professor shrugged shoulder undoubtedly reader would interested much think specialist since question posed replied never considered consider problem  flying saucer  important others consider passion shown subject stir created given  lecture  interesting first purely psychological phenomenon general understandable past people believed woodgoblin rus myth today science fiction scientist conceived  modern  hypothesis compare fairy tale woodgoblin like comparing hoe jet liner sciencefiction boom left noticeable mark consciousness people indeed boom produced quite number interesting idea expanded inner world man gave new meaning world around u ala science fiction also letdown deadends repetition drawn literature science accept also myth ufo era get trapped consciousness instead previous woodgoblins house spirit saint  holy place never empty  literal translation proverb  u let  new tenant  readily conceived act shall say spirit age making claim name science attempt interpret intercept mystery ben studied sufficiently yet science professor dmitriyev one introduced stream health scepticism  saucer  problem found theory two year ago essence theory fact number unusual phenomenon including ball lightning  flying saucer  petrozavodsk phenomenon riddle  bermuda triangle  mystery tunguska explosion others caused being planet visiting earth natural cause substance accumulate various area atmosphere capable reacting one another onset course reaction affected solar ray hard cosmic radiation ordinary lightning aerosol depending nature process taking place natural formation would like call  reactor  believe differently either hang motionless  pursue  airplane repeating motion precisely similar landmines perform abrupt jump usually accompanied effect known luminescence substance entered reaction chemiluminescence energy formation low may go unnoticed person radar screen show unexpected flash energy cluster enormous frought catastrophe type occurred tunguska theory supported experiment calculation many respect still another story green being planet professor decide play role   said  show example people depart urgent problem pseudoproblems ufology  ufo initial letter english equivalent nlo  opinion constitutes urgency problem anomalous atmospheric phenomenon   first study mechanism phenomenon great scientific significance second scientist obligated  give recommendation concerning mean protection    protection   course several year ago example ball lightning got naphthalene storage makeyevskiy byproduct coke plant resulting considerable loss paper described case investigated u especially group mountain climber struck ball lightning known case cattle injured usual lightning protection device ineffective case finally sufficient amount data start talking practical application phenomenon national economy   nt say   yes frequently energy concentrated certain anomalous formation reach  joule us quite efficiently let u say digging tunnel mountain another area show promise obtaining nitrogen compound badly needed production valuable fertilizer   short problem urgent indeed contact world realistic   see supporter hypothesis life earth unique contact world  ten thousand case studied u period twenty year one gave u ground assert someone visited planet   deal greenfaced being described article gave read even lie detector used    selection instrument depends one plan investigate  smiled professor  let u recall nt quite number case history religion virgin saint appeared people convinced anyone vision would confirmed validity swearing lie detector however examine material evidence laboratory left anomalous phenomenon soil water air negative number instrument investigation built u certificate invention wellknown device example scintillating massspectrometer basis color intensity nature luminescence determine substance take part reaction  learned recreate study certain event laboratory observe nature go premise visit even u planet would certainly given u insignificant material piece evidence dust particle short radio signal far repeat piece evidence available u totally different property evidence studying   professor offered another article read article written specialist published journal technical physic go say  th august hour vicinity khasanovskaya sreet khabarovsk heavy downpour  sudden people heard sharp whistle sounded like jet engine accompanied loud cracking became light day ball lightning bright orange color appeared movie theater  zarya  showering spark ball began descend reached ground tree flashed instant certain spot rose huge explosion became dark quiet entire process took one minute many eyewitness event electrical wiring commission distance despite large amount water ground downpour soil charred melted area  diameter  cm deep total volume area filled slag  cubic meter   follows accurately recorded technical detail description slag dimension lump photograph radiometry data verified nii nuclear physic ngu moscow state university however article go say phenomenon repeated laboratory energy flash calculated temperature estimated hot enough melt quartz let u note single word material detail foreign press concerning being outer space assumption ufo based wholly personal story another difference even though mass fine detail khabarovsk version conclusion based detail made  much reservation possible assume probable mechanism ball lightning connected powerful highfrequency magnetic radiation certain frequency range certain wavelength  discussion problem devoid material evidence  say dmitriyev  would resemble religious gathering everything revolves around question believe believe  let u offer argument ufologists one incidentally reproached openly press scientific interest earthbound disbelief meeting soon take place brother intellect   professor sighed  concerned approach scientist problem opinion studying actual event know direct negation problem also indirect negation attempt reduce separate random odd event casus like concentration insect optical illusion sounding balloon course event occur however doubtful thousand case studied u explained event alone one keep quite wellknown fact one time academy science placed ban mention meteorite declared nonexistent stop falling earth hand hushing problem order reduce amount unhealthy speculation around usually produce opposite effect people reason must something keep u thus another impetus created one get carried away ufology annoying see publication show guarded attitude problem also attempt rebut basis scientific materialistic position ufo problem also suffering another aspect originated junction point science interface interact also question instance known along theory chemiluminescence recently another theory proposed professor oceanology institute g barenblat monin director institute back discussed izvestiya crux  theory saucerlike formation unique aerial spinning top serve trap aerosol dmitriyev keep close watch everything relative problem also knowns turbulent theory surmise oceanologists examining electrical chemical aspect aerodynamic aspect phenomenon one know perhaps aerial top pot nature cook mixture toxic effect could reason misfortune bermuda triangle perhaps top produce danger explosion type occurred tungaskaya result dmitriyev convinced fallout biologically active nitrous compound fertilized soil thus caused acceleration pine prepared question visit oceanology institute see g barenblat discover heard neither dmitriyev theory strange work known country example respectable monograph barri published recently new york  ball beaded lightning extreme effect atmospheric electricity bibliography work one hundred eighty name numerous work written academician p kapits dmitriyev single reference made work done oceanologists tell reproach still would like ask one work problem without first finding done area past another known direction investigation conducted represented booklet published space research institute ussr observation anomalous atmospheric phenomenon ussr conducted l grindilis menkov petrovskaya work deal problem rather
