possible effect nuclear weapon realistic scenario day initial offensive note sysop article serious error omission falsehood try add footnote later sure author tried best job could however work use reference wrong summation wrong largest bomb second world war exploded force equivalent thirteen kiloton thirteen thousand ton dynamite tnt bomb called  little boy  ironic thing name bomb compared warhead today word come mind little modern warhead hundred time powerful give little perspective let say fifteen kiloton nuclear missile exploded new york city population lunch report secretarygeneral united nation say eight million people city approximately one million people die first day one megaton bomb exploded detroit approximately  people would die immediately twentyfive megaton bomb exploded approximately  million people would die four million people living megaton equivalent million ton tnt would take  railroad freight car carry one million ton tnt following possible outcome explosion one megaton nuclear warhead city detroit michigan ground zero directly underneath bomb would crater measuring one thousand foot wide two hundred foot deep would highly radioactive rim extending two thousand foot center would keep unprotected person entering circle nearly twentyfive year  mile center would see sign building building within circle would completely destroyed   mile center might able see infrastructure heavily built building would almost survivor  mile ground zero approximately eight mile house would flattened overpressure produced bomb   mile light walled structure would destroyed content top floor strongest building would blown street overpressure five pound per square inch would cause window frame building blown band  mile  mile psi overpressure would cause people blown modern office building would cause million flying projectile projectile capable killing anyone hit wind would cause people blown wall force many time greater gravity fifteen mile explosion wind would cause object fly force capable fracturing skull human fifty percent time bomb would cause death approximately  people first day approximately  billion people world nuclear almanac say approximately million civilian would immediately killed nuclear attack present united state strategic weapon base one megaton warhead know soviet megaton warhead radioactive cloud produced weapon would cover fifty percent united state approximately million people would die cancer genetic defect caused nuclear weapon added predicted death country total death would million people mean   percent earth population would killed within couple year war remember radiation cause sterilization placed calculation study possible fatality united state hypothetical nuclear war explosive power totaled  megaton population million person figured first day million people would die seventh day million would die fourteenth day would total million people dead sixtieth million people would died u remember strategy time military target go large civilian population large industrial area etc would million injured million left uninjured predicted  injured would eventually die injury almost half population united state would die socalled limited attack soviet union ten u refinery using two percent nation nuclear arsenal would kill million u citizen following summary fictional account may happen nuclear attack almost right attack people crowded rural town escaping destroyed city looking food shelter clothing medical attention nothing except clothes back go first day hospital closed door new patient high radioactivity outside room sick left die others left fend radio communication nearly wiped president came air chance one would hear emp would usually talk  ceasefire  kept telling soviet hurt much u told million people killed said government could let remember pres rather nice distance underground likely seeing true report going food became scarce people raided grocery store house people living shelter stealing farmer cattle went wood try find remaining wild animal two week explosion food run people looked government left president said could spring people changed attitude crop planted even tried rebuild city factory government tried stop barter system reinstate currency people found money worthless kept trading thought thing going get better winter came around food ran people started eating dog cat rat animal habitat protected fallout also cockroach weak old young started die first winter took toll living people rebelling government came together figure could come decision would agree everyone one knew life used car computer office golf school superbowl party disappeared left chaos interesting civilization becomes technologically advanced complex could destroy matter moment lifestyle would go back horse buggy era complexity ie computer would forgotten would learn farm care animal probably would able rebuild previous civilization generation survivor would concentrate survival worrying selling stock ibm even going school would use country would set back couple hundred year people might even deny previous civilization turn back simple life one would office taxation hostility might even become friend soviet hopefully people planet one day realize danger nuclear war stop hopefully everyone planet become family working betterment maybe one day become perfect civilization karl marx plato philosopher dreamed note congress u office technology assessment effect nuclear war pp  encyclopedia americana ed sv  nuclear weapon  neville brown
