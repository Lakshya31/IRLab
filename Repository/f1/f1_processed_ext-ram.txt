bios thus system initialization bioses copied rom fast bit bit ram writeprotected bios executes obviously requires motherboard hardware support machine allow part extended memory used expanded memory achieved either hardware support software emulation described machine allow sort permutation area manufacturer clone add value extended memory        msdos assumes thus address first megabyte address space extended memory limited use do commonly used ram disk involves block access memory nicely selfcontained application could also used caching directly application implement expanded memory scheme em bit address space ie megabyte meg plus meg extended memory full bit address space work architecture implementation using use private memory address bus limit addressing megabyte extended memory generally used msdos environment ram disk program disk cache expanded memory emulation several reason available machine application wish compatible across whole product line stay away using directly standard resource proper management coexisting software see msdos  slow pain neck access msdos run native mode ie access meg must switched protected mode fine way switch back native mode one reason regarded braindead processor trick used get keyboard controller reset cpu bios reset code recognizes continues thus really good sort block access memory int function bios done easily using virtual mode problem running do mode trap io etc wont go also usual  dma interact logical addressing  type problem good news unix o make full use extended memory run machine protected mode release  msdos

extended memory specification standard defined jointly microsoft intel lotus ast confused lim see specification available xms  allows extended memory used coresident software example allows tsr positioned extended memory application currently written make use standard somewhat ironic provided ram disk disk caching routine ramdrivesys smartdrvsys use xms management routine using extended
