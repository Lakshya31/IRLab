giri spirit slide must used intelligently use retaliate missedblocked normal special move go projectile refer specific character strategy section s annu mutsube nt work air counter anymore since hit low thus hit airborne opponent however due introduction delay late air ab cd attack annu mutsube still used counter air opponent late air ab cd attack utilise delay stay crouching position opponent jump try hit ab air ab cd attack hit crouched must late go straight annu mutsube get land work requires good timing though use annu mutsube escape trapped corner opponent jump another use move combo see combo section detail also huge lag time afterwards actually used trick opponent make mistake see nakoruru human opponent item g also note extremely close range annu mutsube hit move weakness annu mutsube slight delay time start depends button pressed annu mutsube shorter start time delay ab annu mutsube programmer s decided keep huge lag time executing move ukyos equivalent nearly lag time start quickly  also suffered decrease priority thrown start hit time long opponent time right either ab annoying crouching c kick also annu mutsube shorter s also nt help quest counterstrike opponent

designed air counter move however easy use say haohmaru kogetsuzan travel forward well upwards use move first learn range b ab leyla mutsube far reach also forward use appropriate one applicable situation make sure execute leyla mutsube nakoruru meet opponent air front part knife touching opponent might think using leyla mutsube much trouble get right effective example opponent jump outside jumpingforward abb slash counter leyla mutsube counter nicely also opponent jump away jump straight front execute leyla mutsube hit leyla mutsube also used counter strike move like annu mutsube leyla mutsubes reach opponent slightly faster annu mutsube counterpart ie leyla mutsube reach opponent faster annu mutsube hit low leyla mutsube also used get corner make sure use ab opponent close use sparingly  another use move comboing see combo section also note extremely close range leyla mutsube hit move ground opponent weakness annu mutsube move slight lag time start depends button use huge lag time land therefore must make sure nakoruru start rising opponent land also annu mutsube invincible everyone think opponent attack air touch nakoruru top behind knife good chance knocking move trading also thrown move start quite easily                                       amube yatoro sends falcon burning attack fire damage slash                                       falcon attack important cpu cpu even higher level nearly always jump avoid mamahaha flied forward move used much possible cpu get jump forward hit sky take blocked damage spacing work distance away opponent b amube yatoro reach opponent jump move counter air cpu teleporting ninja trio galford hanzo earthquake knock also execute falcon attack reach get usually try teleport move hit already recovered stun time falcon attack block retaliate amube yatoro however moderately useful human opponent good human opponent automatically jump forward see nakoruru turn summon falcon use get one tick blocked damage sure falcon hit eg opponent get opponent reeling back previous attack etc far away use ab amube yatoro possible use air counter need nearly perfect spacing timing work weakness delay time let nakoruru amube yatoro delay start turn around gesture mamahaha attack end hmm never knew putting one arm go back fighting stance take long  attack path hawk travel also variation easy opponent medium close range roll jump retaliate also falcon nt hit opponent blocked anymore                                       mamahaha flight falcon grab character control switch bird around  second c character fall back ground                                       apart move dive attack yatoro poku kamui mutsube getting falcon us importantly might tempt opponent try jump attack soon see jumping get yatoro poku kamui mutsube hawk opponent uppercut special move eg haohmaru wanfu charlotte etc soon see walking close starting move yatoro poku forward direction falcon way opponent uppercut move miss time retaliate landing also useful ahead energy time nearly say second left getting onto falcon moving away much possible waiting timeout win luring attack also useful weakness well eventually fall hawk damned delay landing  opponent decide anything hawk better quickly move far away opponent possible yatoro poku bird away opponent quickly possible                                       yatoro poku flying spin downward falcon direction corresponding joystick attacking slash weapon damage kick                                       attack falcon useful s although still quite confusing human challenger attack different angle produce confusion direction block apart nt usually use move much hit multiple time opponent hit regardless whether opponent block also useful finishing move need worry whether hit  high priority air anyone try jumping hit falcon executing move hit cleanly also use move escape corner get hawk move hawk corner watching attack opponent yatoro poku opposite direction away also see section mamahaha flight weakness s move lag nakoruru land nakoruru spin slowly sometimes move hit altogether  miss opponent move block must quickly try either crouching b slash throw land recover lag time crouching b slash hit opponent try ab slash                                       kamui mutsube flying fly falcon burning attack sword extended hitting fire damage slash kick joystick must position yatoro poku move                                       kamui mutsube actually better choice attacking mamahaha opinion damamge opponent yatoro poku high priority air guaranteed hit opponent like yatoro poku attack take multiple blocked damamge opponent three tick blocked damage achieved aim opponent head medium close range kamui mutsube move thus great finishing fighter nt much left people nt know also used get corner like yatoro poku compensate longer lag time kamui mutsube actually travel away yatoro poku actually better choice getting corner imho also use attack hit opponent back hisher head manage block still far away enough retaliated weakness longer lag time yatoro poku attack falcon must make sure hit finish attack even block                                       kamui ryuse twirl around whipping cloak create shield reflects projectile slash back opponent well inflicting damage                                       whipping cloak several important us actually important one make invulnerable pet attack also reflects projectile however take bit practice get timing right sometimes still trouble reflecting kyoshiro fan also make sure use kamui ryuse reflect projectile opponent jump projectile time blockcounter second usage move air countering work fairly well long opponent nt air slash attack stay hisher body heshe airborne eg kamui ryuse work air counter ukyo air ab work air kick however well one tried people think move powerful manage hit opponent edge cape however manage envelope opponent cape extreme close range hit move megadamage hit multiple time often dizzies opponent best time use move opponent missed uppercut special move dizzy walk execute ab kamui ryuse close range watch happens hee hee  also trying walk execute move unsuccessful far  possible theoretically  since hit multiple time close range also use finish opponent nt much left knocked case walk execute ab kamui ryuse get weakness move long lag time execution hit opponent edge b ab kamui ryuse recover quicker retaliate make sure nt move mindlessly  also joystick motion move sometimes kamui ryuse come actually trying execute amube yatoro thus put grave situation especially mizuki always send energy pool ground whenever happens                                        apefuchi kamui rymuse performs three quick kamui ryuse finish sending

first thing nakoruru travel far forward hitter thus le fear retaliation afterwards actually almost end position started move finished pretty good damage hit hit like haohmaru tempa fuzzin zan nakoruru invulnerable projectile possibly pet attack first three quick kamui ryuses use move opponent dizzy variety style opponent silly projectile pet attack close range use finish opponent nt much energy left move actually take five tick blocked damage four cape whip connects last whip cape stay longer take two tick blocked energy note using move dizzied opponent make sure close ensure hit hit also make sure opponent corner wo nt get pushed back hit still move forward move therefore opponent chance escapeblock hit throw process also nt use apefunchi kamui rymuse opponent pow metre nearly full power blocking getting hit first one two hit move thrown also use air counter like kamui ryuse want also cpu character human character smaller weapon range air ab opponet sky execute move straight land get blocked damage without fear retaliated weakness move bit lag execution people long range attack like haohmaru ukyo get block move                                       power special irusuka yatoro glowing sends bird lise strike successful five energy falcon dive victim breaking damage                                       ok move look good hit useful try using air counter like amube yatoro hard time get spacing right use range opponent throw slowspeed projectile falcon travel faster slowspeed projectile cancel path still travel forward get opponent even nt cancel opponent projectile long hit opponent first nakoruru invulnerable incoming projectile five falcon plunge opponent body ground weakness apart situation mentioned strongly advise using move especially human

also aggressive s nakoruru cpu controlled character seem advance upon nakoruru quite lot stay outside nakoruru attack range wait make move attack miss jump jump crouch defending cpu move throw jump air attack throw nakoruru player aware know deal situation cpu advancing upon general summary tactic nakoruru player cpu mentioned position ie outside normal attack range within attack range actually pretty basic applies human character fighting cpu character anyway go  cpu run towards happens quite lot example cpu galford wanfu also happens cpu lower energy bar lot time left keep cpu away crouchingstanding c kick andor crouching kick nakoruru usually get kick cpu tick damage make sure stop standing c kick straight away pushed outside standing c kick range go back defensive crouch missed move part cost dearly cpu already run close crouching c kick keep away maybe add one two standing c kick make sure miss crouching kick cpu roll towards careful cpu decide roll toward outside attack range happens many situation example kicked face many time standing c kick crouch nothing send mamahaha attack close range many way deal cpu rolling depends cpu character rolling cpu close rolling eg cpu might rolled series standing c kick say close mean sprite nakoruru opponent overlapping case would suggest quickly get away cpu usually throw come roll close situation like counterthrowing often difficult hop back jump back air c kick see coming ab leyla mutsube get away cpu land front finished rolling quickly lot crouching c kick push away usually get hit like soon outside crouching c kick range switch standing c kick push away opponent roll finish front better chance throwing opponent viable option cpu standing nothing since cpu still outside attack range nt foolish try attack spot miss cpu good detecting use advantage better range hit recovering attack nt tempted jump forward position jump forward overjump get slashedkickedthrown back land cornertrapped nt tempted jump back wall either cpu usually find good way hit air usually try moving forward little bit time opponent standing c kick range try kicking sometimes cpu also back move forward bit bit proven quite useful cpu jumping jump almost top must think way counter attack escape time escapecounter blocked move immediately go crouching c kick crouching slash blocked cpu air attack minimise chance getting thrown refer special move listing us section normal move us section air counter move misc general strategy anticipating opponent attack since nakoruru range attack beat opponent keep

jumpin attack nakoruru air attack much range also due nakoruru long jumping arc easy overjump miss attack completely first thing make sure happen cpu murder hop back enough space overjump usually enough space jump safely opponent block b mamahaha attack get pushed back jumped correctly make sure air attack hit safest attack jump course nakoruru kick also use b ab slash good damage comboed afterwards small character like cham cham safer use kick since air slash sometimes miss crouched overjumped would suggest either try counterthrowing crouching ab roll slash crouching c kick go mutsube

tip human character please let know   staying close opponent ticking okay nak hardly range attack long range falcon summon really hard avoid nak player win stay close opponent tick opponent move closer bit bit within standing c kick range standing c kick move forward standing c kick etc get idea nt get monotonous opponent try quick slash usually standing c kick usually standing c kick faster make sure nt miss also vary attack pattern tick twice annu mutsube time opponent trying get even hisher longer range attack tick run throw see b running make nakoruru lack range attack must learn use runins effectively run throw musthave skill nakoruru player ok considered cheap counter incompetence counterable firstly get know nakoruru throw range properly practise running soon get range press one throw button personally like throw best seems work best run throw thing start running medium close range opponent nt enough time react runandthrows opponent expecting throw start running vary tactic run annu mutsube run go back defensive crouch run standing c kick crouching b slash run jump forward haohmaru ab b  etc c rolling rolling forward throw also work make sure roll close range nakoruru sprite overlap opponent sprite early stage roll crouchattacking roll push forward start pressing throw button  also variation b mentioned running forward soon run close throw range push joystick offensive crouch position roll forward throw opponent get used runningin throw tactic dealing projectile revisited people played much human nakoruru nt usually know nakoruru slide throughunder many projectile stupid enough move situation right annu mutsube hit also human player higher tendency throw projectile also closer range make sure get afterwards blocking close range projectile say projectile get close range slide annu mutsube reflect note reflecting projectile use opponent throw projectile close medium range opponent le time react reflect move forward opponent jump forward projectile air ab slash air jump upwards leyla mutsube get block send mamahaha attack time sometimes opponent move forward bit jump forward straight throw projectile anticipating reflecting projectile watch e punish closerange missed bab attack referring list specific character strategy section opponent miss ab attack block longlagtime attack close range make sure make pay f know air counter againt cpu usually need know air ab crouching cd kick air defence human opponent mix air countering tactic many use work situation nt get predictable especially used use air ab air counter sometimes substitute say close standing ab air counter get predictable opponent simply jump c kick instead hit air ab lot easier one use extensively walking throwattack nt miss chance air counter good human player seldom jump  g luring opponent make mistake well give example knock someone go standing far ab timed finish move time opponent attack many people get fooled attempt slash block since quite close crouching b slash hit attempting slash anyway simply blocking move throw execute annu mutsube finish move outside opponent furtherest attack range another annu mutsube opponent attempt slash bigrange ab h opponent running many good player also try running tactic stated many way deal cpu safest course standing c kick watch stopping early slashing longer range attack try annu mutsube run quite close range usually catch offguard get course counterthrowing important opponent run stop far away run throw also work watch haohmarus genjuros running uppercut special move also watch people sliding attack like cham cham sliding kick running sliding attack know opponent attack range must know heart opponent weapon range quest move closer many people try catch guard one big ab cd kick made closer b slash c kick nt know expect likely caught hit one try move forward know attack range well anticipate counter stay outside range opponent nt know range well miss annu mutsube get quite hard first get easier get experienced game guess j thing remembertry another list example  knocked someone stand next jump straight cd kick air opponent get must make block land throw get hit annu mutsube get falcon medium close range move falcon give bit room opponent try jump attack get uppercut special move get kamui mutsube falcon immediately  combo s combo system understand seems s character hit first reeling back frame hit subsequent attack opponent reeling back frame go beyond first frame wo nt hit comboing must make sure second hit hit opponent opponent reel back much combo s mainly based using shortrange attack followed longer range attack since nakoruru lack longrange attack harder twohit combo ground normal move quite possible really close example crouching c kick followed crouching cd kick b standing close b slash followed crouching standing cd kick c crouching c kick standing c kick etc  experiment see work get habit executing second attack first one hit multihitters include crouching ab roll standing close cd kick jumping straightup cd kick executed late land kamui ryuse leyla mutsube annu mutsube move hit opponent twice executed close range apefunchi kamui rymuse hit four time maximum mutsube move chained also medium heavy attack form hit combo attack close standing b slash close standing kick crouching kick crouching b slash close

air ab slash air cd kick abab annu mutsube small character like cham cham nicotine use cd kick instead ab slash since ab slash downtoup slash easily miss character must make sure ab strike fairly late land combo work otherwise annu mutsube hit even though blocking yet try use annu mutsube come faster note combo work kyoshiro often strange reason  kyoshiro seems go invulnerable part reeling back frame lot faster anyone else  unless strike kyoshiro ab last possible moment land dont attempt combo variation substitute air ab either air b air two must make sure hit opponent fairly late land must close second attack must annu mutsube case                                     air c kick close standing b slash crouching b slash annuleyla mutsube carried s use standing slash second hit combo annu mutsube use crouching slash second hit use leyla mutsube third hit suggestion fluid joystick movement since standing close b slash time pulling back easier move joystick annu mutsube similarly crouching attacking natural move joystick position leyla mutsube note must close second attack character sprite must nearly overlapping even closer opponent enough time recover block third mutsube attack variation substitute first air attack either air b slash air kick air b attack must hit opponent back head ie must extremely close otherwise second b slash miss                                     close standing crouching b slash annuleyla mutsube basically without air attack also use close standind crouching kick instead b slash first attack must make sure execute annu mutsube fast possible
