pyrotxt preparation contact explosive part series file pyrotechnic explosive serious stuff really dangerous nt treat seriously kid watch many cartoon remember part body get blown away real world stay blown away cant treat stuff respect nt screw around file start set safety rule nt skip read em memorize em beginning set general rule always apply thing know material using making time read thoroughly starting anything pyrotechnic preparation explosive nature unstable subject ignition explosion heat shock friction clear understanding dangerous property due care handling ingredient finished product necessary accident avoided always observe possible precaution particularly following mix small batch one time mean gram ounce nt go big mix  make bigger accident power explosive cube every ounce ounce time powerful one ounce weighing chemical use clean piece paper scale pan item discard used paper bucket water weighing next ingredient safe worker dispose chemical spilled workbench equipment weighing nt keep open container chemical table since accidental spillage mixing may occur finished container close replace storage shelf use clean equipment chemical ground grind separately never together thoroughly wash clean equipment grinding another ingredient mixing batch done outdoors away flammable structure building barn garage etc mix also made non metallic container avoid spark glass also used since shatter case accident handy small container made cutting top plastic bottle three four inch bottom mix may conveniently made placing ingredient plastic bottle rolling around mixture uniform case point open end container away never hold body face container stirring done wooden paddle stick avoid spark static powdered ground material may also mixed placing large sheet paper flat surface rolling across sheet lifting side corner one time never ram tamp mix paper cardboard tube pour material gently tap shake tube settle content store ingredient finished mix fire hazard away heat flame finished preparation may stored plastic bottle shatter case accident since many ingredient mix poisonous stored reach child pet preferably locked away sure thread screw top container cap thoroughly cleaned applies also container stopper rubber cork type closure trace mixture caught container closure may ignited friction opening closing container throughout procedure work clean condition always wear face shield least shatterproof safety glass careful worker handling dangerous material sure lens frame flammable always wear dust respirator handling chemical dust form small particle gather lung stay may cause serious illness later life always wear glove working chemical always wear waterproof lab apron must work indoors good ventilation system never smoke anywhere near working make sure open flame present motor produce spark inside hot water heater furnace pilot light stove spark known readily explode dust floating air always work someone two head better one source water readily available fire extinguisher hose etc never circumstance use metal load chemical put chemical firework metal casing worse handle live hand grenade never use metal container includes dangerous co cartridge many people killed flying fragment metal casing please use metal circumstance always thoroughly familiar chemical using information included file look whatever extra information material thought safe later found dangerous stuff wash hand face thoroughly using chemical nt forget wash ear nose device built fails work leave alone half hour may try bury never try unload reuse dud dust particle start form air stop leave settle read entire file trying anything never strike mixture containing chlorate nitrate perchlorate permanganate bichromate powdered metal nt drop even handle roughly rule may look like lot silly nonsense let look one example move  wizard oz  made actress played good witch severely burned one exploding special effect got hand actress played bad witch got really messed green coloring used face original actor played tin man got lung destroyed aluminum dust used color face actor know tin man actually replacement point chemical used direction people lot knowlegable chemical terrible accident still happened nt take stuff lightly contact explosive describing use chemical need extra caution keep causing trouble iodine crystal though people nt realize iodine brown liquid steelgrey solid tincture iodine buy drugstore actually contains tiny bit iodine dissolved jarful inexpensive alcohol resold huge mark using iodine crystalline form contact skin produce dark stain wo nt wash soap water talk removing stain later get hot vaporizes purple cloud smell like chlorine swimming pool cloud dangerous inhale since condense lung corrosive since wo nt need heat stuff problem make sure nt let iodine crystal spill onto hot surface nt touch keep away face nt trouble ammonium hydroxide good old household ammonia sure get clear kind sudsy stuff wo nt useful made ammonia gas dissolved water every time open bottle loses strength sure use fresh stuff need strong possible formula given use lab grade concentrated ammonium hydroxide much stronger supermarket kind unkind skin especially eye good idea wear eye protection even supermarket grade though nt usually worry using household ammonia cleaning usually dilute using straight bottle much corrosive form never use material nt real good ventilation ammonia vapor overpowering potassium iodide reasonably safe chemical get potassium ion fruit eat iodide ion usually sodium iodide added table salt buy store nt directly eat chemical eat component make nt scared stuff sodium thiosulfate otherwise known photographic hypo dissolved water remove iodine stain left touching iodine crystal exploding contact explosive particularly nasty stuff make sure wash cleaning general information powerful highly sensitive explosive dust sized particle make sharp crack popping sound piece size pencil lead produce explosion loud largest firecracker cherry bomb exploded mean wet therefore handled applied safety dry explode touch feather breath air strength ammonia water use direct effect strength final product use supermarket ammonia explosive work spectacularly use higher molar solution stronger better also need filter paper funnel properly folded coffee filter nicely nt filter paper sure fold filter paper check elementary chemistry textbook method preparation granular explosive easiest kind kind work reasonably well supermarket ammonia crush enough iodine crystal make pile powder equal volume pencil eraser grind fine powder put ounce  measuring cup strong ammonia water small container iodine seal minute shaking frequently mixture reacting get filter paper ready best consult book show take circle filter paper fold half fold right angle first fold open form cone open close needed make conform angle funnel moisten little make stick place place funnel container catch waste liquid let mixture settle long enough sediment settle pour much clear liquid possible filtering sediment pour remaining liquid sediment filter sediment filter paper covered explosive small amount made go lot farther realize particularly used good strong ammonia place explosive airtight leakproof pill bottle explosive unstable nature fresh amount give better result stale one sitting around day best result obtained small fresh batch see trick material require sit day explosive stored applied wet paint type explosive use lot iodine crystal make strong tincture iodine using ounce  measuring cup rubbing alcohol denatured alcohol wood alcohol wood alcohol preferable add iodine crystal shake thoroughly dissolve pour liquid fruit jar add ammonium hydroxide stir mixture mixture chocolate brown show little original color iodine amount ammonia necessary depend strength equal volume ammonia usually sufficient higher solution solution filtered nt ever wait minute start dissolve explosive stored applied wet material chemically granular explosive precipitated solution much finely divided reaction happens almost simultaneously get vanishes back solution paint type dissolve gram potassium iodide cc  ammonium hydroxide add gram pulverized iodine deep black sediment start forming let stand stir frequently five minute filter usual potassium iodide integral part chemical reaction dissolved potassium iodide allow iodine crystal turn dissolve common ion effect cause le iodine crystal wasted since iodine far expensive ingredient save money long run using care handling storage material unstable deteriorates quickly nt make need use next hour ca nt use immediately container keep recapped tightly use mouth wiped clean explosive cause dark stain damage thing rug clothing chair seat wallpaper light clear plastic strong solution sodium thiosulfate effective removing stain hand clothing set never leave container explosive direct sunlight minute weaken strength attempt make large explosion dangerous cause deafness equipment used thoroughly washed used filter paper flushed toilet circumstance attempt handle dried material extremely explosive hazardous avoid storing material
