altcascade unfortunately cascaders would generally rather cascade newsgroups take lot message build completed cascade targeted newsgroup soon fill message course complain bombarded message first amendment artistic expression  worse another cascade thing ignore setting killfile also certain newsgroups killfiles come handy way newsgroups organized example reader recartstvsoaps always use acronym subject line show writing amc example  child  way people want read  one life live  blank message  young restless  others keep people accidentally screening message might contain letter  gh   general hospital  viewer always use  gh  subject line nn rn let create killfiles different way create killfile nn go newsgroup offending message type capital k see bottom screen auto k ill elect cr

default killfile generator work message specific group rather globally entire newsgroup list create global killfile write one create killfile rn go newsgroup offending message type number get screen

kill news subdirectory first line type word phrase name nt want see followed command tell rn whether search entire message word name find line must form patternmodifier j  pattern  word phrase want rn look case insensitive  test   test  knocked modifier tell rn whether limit search message header useful object never see message particular person look entire message h look header leave modifier command case rn look subject line message  j  end tell rn screen article offending word never want see word  foo  header ever type fooh j particularly useful getting rid article people post one newsgroup cascaders since article newsgroup name always header want block message subject line cascade could try foo j kill anything followup article use pattern subject j done writing line phrase screen exit text editor normally would put back rn one word caution go easy global killfile extensive global killfile one make frequent use modifier dramatically slow rn since system look every single
