crash private research project investigating series strange aerial light energy event reported various area western australia area australia past year seen increasing frequency last three month year mayjuly light event involve either static moving beam orangered light energy usually vertical hanging sky sometimes horizontal degress moving orangered light energy sphere fire ball traveling speed roughly equivalent high speed jet aircraft  mph observed traveling distance hundred kilometer massive high energy ripple light flash lasting  second intense bluewhite colour seen altitude ground level description  someone giant arc welder  assortment green intense blue white red light varying size large moon mostly small light energy event reported many reliable bush observer geologist pilot air passenger meteor astronomer prospector cattle sheep station ranch owner truck driver aboriginal people tourist etc event rarely ever reported prior generally due meteor meteor fireball etc due nature expert eyewitness evidence thunderstorm lightning emission ever present generally appear natural origin due several consideration evidence definitely involve electromagnetic potential field transmission certain instance caused main power outage electrical streamer issuing house power box diesel generator winding burn hf frequency radio interference microwave telephonic link interference peculiar style moving redorange light sometimes resulted either massive aerial explosion ground based explosion earthquake case follow aircraft keeping formation static orange beam observed naval military base fremantle isolated outback area many aspect witness evidence place event far  natural scenario  exotic man made arena event seen isolated outback area significant percentage occur population center eg  one orangered light flew observer northeastern goldfield region wa  hit  ground caused  richter earthquake massive explosion heard area km x km followed rise ground large hemisphere bright opaque redorange light equivalent size twothree setting moon silver lining hovered two hour  bobbing bit  turning  someone threw light switch  good eyewitness cross fix event allowed excellent ground air search crater anomalous ground disturbance kind could found although first incident resembled fireball meteor many aspect eyewitness evidence consideration indicate meteor probably high energy electrical event peculiar type originally believed event caused detonation small one kilotonne nuclear weapon much ground airborne research site consideration similar event certain test exotic scalar em weapon another event st may consisted bright redorange ball traveled south perth point eastern part city exploded force estimated several megatonnes altitude several km waking half city eyewitness reported enormous burst bluewhite light energy building ground shook although classified meteor fireball several aspect case suggest otherwise indicate electromagnetic event many event classified  planet alien ufo  sighting however detailed analysis suggests alien lot closer home rarely solid object involved massive light energy discharge probably offshoot electromagnetic energy transmission associated electrical potential effect possible relevance research twa investigation explained later body email first wish review data press report western australia twa crash event news report state wa sunday time newspaper  new york u military official said yesterday saw flash light similar shooting star cross plane path twa flight jet crashed pilot helicopter patrol wednesday night jumbo jet exploded  know strike missile saw nt look like missile  said commander fritz meyer th rescue wing new york air national guard  three man crew saw thing flash red orange light characteristic shooting star  said  saw small explosion followed large explosion ball fire fell sea  end internet data say  pentagon denied initial dan rather cbs news report radar sighting object circled jumbo jet twice said object get static electronic noise type glitch radar system time coincident explosiondowning jet airliner  thus believe press report air national guard eyewitness report orangered flash light characteristic ie similar shooting star reported radar static glitch detected civilianmilitary radar screen may indicate similarity event witnessed australia orangered light beam ball looking like shooting star meteor evidence em connection engaged research one half year discussion many scientist investigative reporter japan australia usa russia uk led deduction australian event involve testing exotic new electromagnetic weapon truly prodigious power support statement made summary email backup data paper etc remote australian  outback  appears used training crew deployment operation weapon system believe weapon employ  post einsteinian relativistic physic  principle linked development tesla wireless energy transmission theory may involve transmission beam high energy microwave elfvlf frequency band deployment global transmitter destroy target planetary antipode transmitted ship plane satellite nearer target time evidence tx source exotic event australia believe fact energy transmission originate distance shore although plane shot australia one usa scientist tom bearden belief evidence one shot canada year ago type weapon put touch desire weapon apparently several variant cause enormous nuclear blast type explosion minus radioactivity actually create major earthquake vaporize solid object hit aircraft totally destroy turn engine destroying jet flame energy destroy electronics system terminate life target area create warp storm weather front onto target area apparently human body exposed type energy blast decay much slowly normal irradiated cobalt weapon initially developed brought line russian control kgb army navy unit subsequently believe israeli french developed principle apparently usa yet busy trying develop eg alaskan haarp project three month ago russian broadcast radio moscow programme admitting existence deployment scalar em weapon call  torsion field energetics  boasting huge lead rest world also stated recently  extreme right wing kgb controlled  russian presidential candidate zherinovsky sp bbc tv documentary claimed kgb controlled weapon termed  elipton bomb  russia massive military advantage due existence deployment system development lead evidence amassed researcher usa point soviet predisposition  showing  weapon around planet st may especially large display seen five yearly interval russian physic academician source indicated via british engineer weapon exist worried kgb control antic weapon system possible proliferation terrorist state andor use world wide  one world government  cabal control group    american scientific colleague worried based information received iran iraq syria definitely libya coaxed soviet scientist knowledge em system work develop

structure apparent link north korea see also http wwwpelagocom aum sect set soviet assistance joint sovietjapan university moscow brightest young nuclear physicist japan russia concentrated upon developing modern variant russian em weapon addition modern japanese computing power electronics etc developing exotic weapon mass destruction although certain believe exotic redorange light energy event seen around australia relate initially kgb demonstration aum japanese paymaster eg  orangered sphere ground explosion earthquake hour red hemisphere occurred northeastern goldfield area wa day ship naval carrier task force usn ran vessel docked fremantle harbour probably demonstration kgb japanese client em weapon tech work naval task force could destroyed flick switch since  weapon testing japanese group possibly secret base taiwan japanese island archipelago east however could equally well russia mentioned nation utilizing u weapon testing range exact data top secret scenario difficult potentially dangerous come space allow discus outline datainformation subject em weapon desire info shall happy speak phone etc put communication contact bizarre international research topic etc purpose email alert fact exotic em weapon type exists news report quoted suggest possibility used shoot twa nature weapon system appear natural event eg meteor  shooting star  radar electronic static earthquake shorted circuit board etc therefore missed investigator operating without knowledge viewpoint required recognise relevant however subtle difference little bit expert apparent reluctance black box recorder emit beeper noise instance hence remaining undetected dealing em weapon strike board electrical system including black box matter well shielded faraday cage equivalent probably junked time em  field  impact hence longer working order therefore much like interview commander fritz meyer th rescue wing new york air guard crew able see best radar tape event review total eyewitness report crash debris data order see em weapon theory fit bill   course quite possible reported flash orangered light indeed  shooting star  impacted say   mph thus causing accident eyewitness data help decide scenario fit best perhaps type missile involved however lack contrail report date incredibly lucky shot necessary small warhead small missile extreme range tend mitigate scenario similarity panam lockerbie incident also disturbing obviously bomb board candidate reconcile air national guard report orange red flash light followed two explosion onboard bomb careful examination eyewitness evidence factual data minute detail resolve issue especially public confidence peace mind relative friend dead need another  lee harvey oswald  type outcome aware exotic nature statement em weapon intention help elucidate fact terrible event unfortunately look much like act war found terrorist criminal manmade event hope usa nail bastard good proper western australia large
