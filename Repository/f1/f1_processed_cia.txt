autobiography biography spy activity outright lie done really maintain myth english secret intelligence continue get money continue operate thats real reason ostensible reason trying confuse soviet well bullshit confused one one think really great khruschev remembers anybody right mind belief nikita khruschev sat dictated memoir somebody  strobe talbot sneaked soviet union crazy story lie book joint operation cia kgb exact reason wanted influence public way pretending khruschev done stuff lucked somehow gotten book soviet could system allow khruschev write memoir thats everything communist system stand need speak certain issue brezhnev particularly needed shortcircuit initiative right wing stalinist wing party course kgb going allow book published soviet union stuff got could published american nt mean kgb nt let copy slip soviet union let go around soviet achieved purpose one fantastic case think intelligence history two rival government cooperated secret operation dupe respective public always wanted go much greater length never got around suffice say time magazine threatened cancel twopage magazine article book nt cut brief mention episode book fd operation initially set marchetti nt know in out imagine happened probably started somebody soviet politburo going khruschev saying  hey behind scene lot trouble rightwing stalinist type giving brehznev bad time trying

counterpart see information get west publish get back soviet union variety form get back summary broadcast voice america radio liberty copy book come back article written smuggled turn big influence intelligentsia party leader undercut suslov right winger  khruschev said okay kgb went cia explained thing cia said well sound good get friend time magazine bureau moscow jerry schecter would later job white house press officer get people like strobe talbot working bureau get guy act gobetweens come see memoir everyone play dumb give two suitcase full tape laugh something like let get soviet union exactly happened strobe brought stuff back washington timelife began process put book together would nt let anybody hear tape nt show anybody anything lot people suspicious know tell public anybody else nt least brain head soviet union operates get away anybody know least bit soviet union know whole thing impossible former soviet premier sit dacha make tape give u newspaperman let walk country done closed society police state like soviet union book eventually published published another little interesting affair strobe talbot went helsinki manuscript met kgb took back leningrad looked finally published timelife none ever explained book couple journalist made reference episode never went open secret press corp washington new york nobody ever wrote real big story lot reason guess kind story difficult get hook knew people white house state department suspicious thought kgb  fd duped time marchetti exactly learned deal quieted ceased objection complaint even alibied lied afterwards part bigger game victor lewis apparently instrumental negotiation later fit one little footnote story often wondered lewis  happened little furor existed official washington began dying victor lewis went tel aviv medical treatment came country quietly somebody spotted grabbed said  israel   well medical treatment  lewis said said  israel medical treatment  said  yes  said  well whats problem   ive got lumbago back problem ca nt fix soviet union great jewish doctor knew soviet union came see  sound like craziest story ever wanted hear another individual appeared israel time reporter spotted happened richard helm thendirector cia asked helm israel kind lame excuse started people wondering whether payoff helm acting cia timelife u government lewis acting kgb politburo soviet government really fascinating story wrote briefly book short find look book section talking publication thing like wrote paragraph nt much could go lot speculation analysis around time book came time magazine decided would twopage spread news section give boost suddenly started getting call jerry schecter strobe talbot cutting part said would cut unless could look eye say wrong nt true would take book cut material neither chose right article appeared time got call one editor telling people wanted kill article asked said one reason say time magazine involved khruschev remembers book asked  thats  talked jerry strobe backstab editor asked could find somebody could trump people trying article killed somebody could verify credential telling story said nt call richard helm time eased office kissinger nixon ambassador teheran editor called helm verify credential laughing helm said  yeah he good guy got pissed wanted change cia  article ran time think one people explained story depth fd operation name marchetti probably already agency dont know know sensitive activity people high white house state department would thought would aware aware subsequently clearly taken room talked discussion longer critic doubter fact became defender fd let make sure clear cia motivation  marchetti cia motivation former soviet premier talking event career revealing pretty interesting thing thinking thinking others show soviet union run small little clique small byzantinelike clique strong tendency stick stalinisn turn stalinism cooler head moderate type trying make change good stuff cia point view u government point view dealing primary rival look khruschev dictate thing secrecy smuggled soviet union thing like subtle consistency black white thing surface might say  well wrong  wrong lie truth would much effective nikita khruschev approached kgb soviet politburo dictate memoir supervision mean nt know telling whole story complete truth opportunity edit russian anxious get information could come back soviet union two reason first build international pressure second build internal pressure stalinist anxious willing make deal cia give u material could prepare book thats kind government dealing kind people kind lie live fd let turn world affair moment one event recent year always puzzled united state support vanaaka party new hebrides island late new hebrides achieved independence basically two faction fighting see would maintain control colonial power left british french governed new hebrides concept known condominium independence british labor movement australia threw support behind ubiquitous socialist faction case vanaaka party french offered behindthescenes support second faction basically profree market prowest u jimmy carter went along british idea might done marchetti offhand nt cia learned year sometimes support people would prefer support popular power gain control maintain control without revolution thing sort classic example west berlin back contesting russian influence berlin time russian east german putting tremendous pressure west berlin go almost voluntarily soviet bloc united state struggling mightily keep west berlin free point time strong power west germany christian democrat konrad adenauer people supporting christian democrat however wherewithal save west berlin situation social democrat one could save west berlin getting why wherefore policy position social democrat also charismatic person named willy brandt backing willy brandt social democrat instead putting egg christian democratic party basket brandt social democrat able maintain free west berlin able achieve goal people cia thought terrible ideologically pure one happens e howard hunt actually considered willy brandt kgb spy time guess would call choose lesser two evil might miscalculated gamble nt fact maybe thinking left prowest faction power may end goddamned civil war fd retrospect carter administration decision seems even tragic mistaken since coming power vanaaka party consolidated power new country known vanuatu established diplomatic relation government like cuba vietnam socialist vanuatu come serve beacon sort independence movement part world kanaks new caledonia subsequently adopted socialism ideology asked jimmy carter interview recently said sorry remember episode possible may incompetent blunder part u government somebody nt homework result responsible decision nt fact marchetti absolutely absolutely yes kind issue draw attention washington pointed jimmy carter nt even remember sure decision made pretty far line carter ever make decision probably nt even remember probably staffed considered inconsequential time carter everyone involved considered inconsequential nt even remember something signed guess told mistake fd mentioned e howard hunt earlier understand wrote article washingtonbased publication assassination john f kennedy hunt sued publication charging libel could give u background matter marchetti article written summer published spotlight weekly newspaper advertises voice american populist party time wrote article spotlight house select committee assassination getting ready hold hearing reviewing kennedy king assassination picked information around town memo recently uncovered cia cia concerned believe memo james angleton time chief counterintelligence richard helm forget exact date memo something like six year old helm still office director memo said point time cia going deal fact hunt dallas day kennedy assassination word effect information know anything nt anything back forth piece information along information house select committee going come tape indicated one shooter kennedy assassination fbi least certain people fbi believed tape accurate always believed one shooter contact house select committee probing real deeply thing suspicious kennedy assassination reporter working story time one particular tremendous reputation felt something rushed print spotlight story saying based everything put together information tried predict going happen essence said whats going happen committee going unearth new information one shooter probably come memo internal cia memorandum thing cia conduct limited hangout admit error mistake sweep everything else rug process may let people dangle wind like e howard hunt frank sturgis jerry hemming people mentioned past involved something related kennedy assassination kind speculative piece happened week article appeared spotlight wilmington newsjournal published article joe trento longer farranging article discussed memo greater detail couple week hunt informed spotlight wanted retraction checked source said nt think retract said followup article time cia guy caught stealing picture committee spy thing really hot heavy time lot expectation committee going something really good work bring investigation around said spotlight let followup piece publisher chickened said nah tell hunt give equal space say whatever want amount space hunt ignored offer couple month later hunt come town secret hearing committee heard executive session hunt suing publisher book coup detat america deposed relation case brought tried slip spotlight article instruction lawyer comment lawyer would refuse answer ground journalistic privilege also ground relationship cia lawyer gone cia gave deposition asked said tell hide behind injunction told lawyer nt understand told cia said hate hunt hate going give hunt help end thought two year ran hunt finally sued spotlight article spotlight thought joke thing considered really didnt pay attention never even went trial never even submitted affidavit deposed anything hunt people nt even try call witness anything left everything hunt ended winning judgment  spotlight got worried appealed florida appellate court overturned decision certain technical ground sent back retrial retrial finally occurred earlier year came time retrial close year prepare spotlight got serious went hired good lawyer mark lane something expert kennedy assassination got become involved everything ended going beating hunt pant jury came think within several hour verdict favor interesting thing jury said clearly guilty libel actual malice suspicious hunt everything invoked brought lot stuff hunt hunt lost ordered pay court cost addition everything else subsequently filed appeal appeal imagine probably another six month year hear anything based everything seen hunt nt leg stand deeper get run risk exposing kind material hunt deposition joe trento saying yes saw internal cia memo produced one witness deposition marita lorenz castro lover one point said hunt taking people like sturgis jerry hemmings others running gun dallas lorenz said couple day assassination hunt met dallas made payoff whether connected assassination nt know think hunt keep pursuing setting stage people come forward say bad thing raise evidence dallas day must involved something nt assassination must kind diversionary activity maybe something unrelated assassination wire got crossed coincidence time one key point mind jury far able tell spotlight hunt day still come alibi day assassination hunt come weakest phoniest story ca nt corroborate guy drunk came bar waved story nt match guy story hunt say produce child testify washington none child appeared trial strange thing hunt clearly mind washington say nov certainly work day cia subject come whether sick leave annual leave hell hunt come good alibi hunt gone committee rockefeller committee believe church committee house select committee nobody give hunt clean bill health always weasel word comment hunt always sort way interpreted anyway want say indicates committee looked feel nt involved look say committee looked lot doubt hunt careful saying hunt tell happened committee say testimony classified information well testimony vindicates hunt provides alibi ca nt tell u mystery remains fd believe possible cia know hunt nov want release information marchetti guess think subsequently cia may known hunt time may even realized year year later name started commonly mentioned connection assassination think cia probably know hunt strong feeling happy whatever hunt involved seems would appear around dallas time assassination involved kind clandestine activity may illegal clandestine activity even something cia unaware cia act strangely cia give hunt help got help cia preparation case u presentation case left hunt managed scrounge couple cia friend willing give help caved right away one guy nt testify another guy gave stupid deposition middle night u laugh nt worth paper written helm gave deposition said nothing way would go limb hunt mind feeling cia know hunt going prosecute lot reason involved coverup nt want bring embarrassment upon agency hand feel screw around get mit ringer fault cover as hunt part apparently feel sort pressure cia might strong enough bring forward defend committee court law least strong enough take overt action seems kind double graymail hunt graymailing cia one hand graymailing hand strange thing fd jerry hemmings give deposition understand still prison marchetti think jerry might still asked give deposition called witness unless absolutely necessary either coming toward end term parole preferred get involved pretty much attitude another individual mentioned left feeling push really came shove people could brought forward know whether going risk perjury pretty big gamble dealing mark lane particularly subject he brilliant lawyer subject lot background fd gordon novel fit marchetti fd mentioned possible cia withholding information hunt whereabouts nov cia accused many time past engaging coverup jfk assassination believe still covering lot way marchetti oh yeah think think fbi think everybody covering fd covering necessarily keep american people dark episode coverup guilt complicity marchetti think think started happened nt think anybody really sure washington behind assassination think fearful nt come lone nut theory case lone nut removed scene matter day american people might panic might lose faith government might lose faith institution might begin point finger kind people russian cuban element society like right wing organized crime think consensus mind establishmentarians government put bed quickly quietly possible make hero kennedy let forget course warren commission blueribbon panel would right people lay thing rest officially essentially happened nt hear lot evidence ignored evidence evidence hidden evidence destroyed think pretty much clear nobody absolutely forthcoming former head cia allen dulles even said would lie people anything considered pertain national security dulles said would lie people think kennedy assassination laid rest establishment became suspicion mind people came revelation think everybody involved deeply involved coverup maybe became even paramount question kill kennedy admit covered begining covering ever since think would devastating would year ago say ok looked figured cia renegade whoever responsible murdering kennedy think many people feel may started originally noble motif adjust saw watergate affair see every day life somebody start lying covering snowball keep going keep getting harder harder harder determine truth think pretty difficult somebody come forward say yes part coverup year ago saying lived lie life nt think ever going get answer frankly nt think every going get answer story fd pessimistic american people discovering real truth jfk assassination marchetti say year historian may get access material everybody dead buried might able put together pretty accurate story even time gone myth established people say  ugh conspiracy theorist  people say  never believe government  effect fd believe time reveal full truth jfk assassination truth wo nt revealed another big government scandal like watergate president committed seeing case solved marchetti one president might unearthed actually potential president bobby kennedy got rubbed fd bobby kennedy made statement three day murdered felt office presidency could get truth marchetti sure thats possible wonder mind let say teddy kennedy would elected president wonder one would courage reopen case point time knowing everything know probably two courage would muscle able resolve completely fully satisfaction everyone think thing life either resolve time never awhile year pas becomes difficult impossible fd american people told choose leader run government true invisible state within state intelligence community marchetti nt think intelligence community although invisible arm government run think people run country people usually run thing world powerful economic interest whether banker industrialist whatever real solid inner core establishment mover shaker nt absolute power may want certain person get nominated certain party case may even able stop getting power using generally speaking influence government people manifested sort way force work fd one last question psi cia kgb great interest area one thing know cia attempt recruit kgb agent afterlife familiar marchetti know great interest whole area parapsychology whatever benefit may achieved cia pentagon involved matter kgb everybody apparently examined lot story floating around cia tried contact old agent like penkovsky captured killed executed soviet union hope could derive additional information knowledge none stuff really worked fd thank victor marchetti  could derive additional information knowledge none stuff really worked fd tha
