processing function previously done computer operation personnel advance greatly improved efficiency effectiveness also present serious challenge achieving adequate data security excellent progress made computer technology little done inform user vulnerability data information threat unauthorized modification disclosure destruction either deliberate accidental guide make aware undesirable thing happen data provide practical solution reducing risk threat responsible protecting data information statement  security everyone responsibility  absolutely true owner developer operator user information system personal responsibility protect resource functional manager responsibility provide appropriate security control information resource entrusted manager personally responsible understanding sensitivity criticality data extent loss could occur resource protected manager must ensure user data system made aware practice procedure used protect information resource nt know security responsibility ask manager supervisor  sensitive  data data sensitive degree exactly sensitive unique business environment within federal government personal information sensitive unauthorized disclosure privacy act case data far sensitive accidental error omission compromise accuracy integrity availability example management information system inaccurate incomplete obsolete information result erroneous management decision could cause serious damage require time money rectify data information critical agency ability perform mission sensitive nonavailability still data sensitive fraudulent manipulation personal gain system process electronic fund transfer control inventory issue check control account receivables payable etc fraudulently exploited resulting serious loss agency one way determine sensitivity data ask question  cost data wrong manipulated fraudulent purpose available given wrong person  damage tolerate data sensitive adequate security control prevent lessen potential loss risk associated use computer past several decade computer taken virtually major recordkeeping function recently personal computer made costeffective automate many office function computerization many advantage stay however automated system introduce new risk take step control risk concerned risk existed manual procedure used well new risk created unique nature computer one risk introduced computer concentration tremendous amount data one location greater concentration greater consequence loss damage another example computer user access information remote terminal must able positively identify user well ensure user able access information function authorized newspaper account computer  hacker  computer virus attack type intruder underscore reality threat government commercial computer system much security enough matter many control safeguard use never achieve total security however decrease risk proportion strength protective measure degree protection based value information word serious would consequence certain type information wrongfully changed disclosed delayed destroyed general responsibility federal computer system user share certain general responsibility information resource protection following consideration guide action treat information would valuable asset would walk away desk leaving cash valuable unattended take care protect information sure value sensitivity various kind information handle ask manager guidance use government computer system lawful authorized purpose computer system use daily work used authorized purpose lawful manner computer crime law prescribe criminal penalty illegally access federal computer system data additionally unauthorized use federal computer system use authorized privilege unauthorized purpose could result disciplinary action observe policy procedure established agency management specific requirement protection information established agency requirement may found policy manual rule procedure ask manager unsure responsibility protection information recognize accountable activity computer system receive authorization use federal computer system become personally responsible accountable activity system accordingly use restricted function needed carry job responsibility report unusual occurrence manager many loss would avoided computer user would report circumstance seem unusual irregular warning signal could include thing unexplainable system activity perform data appears questionable accuracy unexpected incorrect processing result notice anything questionable nature bring manager attention security control guideline commonsense protective measure reduce risk loss damage disclosure information following important area information system control assure system properly used resistant disruption reliable make certain one impersonate password used verify identity key system security disclose password anyone allow anyone observe password enter signon process choose password avoid selecting password personal association one simple short aim select password would difficult guess derive  reddog  would better password  duke  system allows change password regularly find agency requires change password least frequently periodic password change keep undetected intruder continuously using password legitimate user logged computer attribute activity user id therefore never leave terminal without logging  even minute always log otherwise inactivate terminal one could perform activity user id away area safeguard sensitive information disclosure others people often forget lock sensitive report computer medium containing sensitive data leave work area information carelessly left top desk unlocked storage casually observed deliberately stolen every employee work sensitive information lockable space available storage information use nt sure information locked locked storage available ask manager working aware visibility data personal computer terminal display screen may need reposition equipment furniture eliminate overtheshoulder viewing especially careful near window public area label sensitive diskette computer medium alert employee need especially careful longer needed sensitive information deleted discarded way unauthorized individual recover data printed report finely shredded data magnetic medium overwritten file merely deleted really erased still recovered install physical security device software personal computer value popularity personal computer make theft big problem especially lowsecurity office area relatively inexpensive hardware device greatly reduce risk equipment loss device involve lockdown cable enclosure attach equipment furniture another approach place equipment lockable cabinet data stored hard disk take step keep unauthorized individual accessing data power lock device allows keyholders turn power personal computer need segregate information multiple authorized user personal computer additional security form software probably needed specific file could encrypted make unintelligible unauthorized staff access control software divide storage space among authorized user restricting user file avoid costly disruption caused data hardware loss disruption delay expensive one enjoys working frantically reenter work job twice fix problem new work pile disruption prevented impact disruption minimized advance planning proper environmental condition power supply minimize equipment outage information loss many electrical circuit office area
