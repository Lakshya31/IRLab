enhancement vary early optimization project yielded performance enhancement enhancement provided chip alone intelpage pentium processor technical detail q pentium processor differ intel cpu new feature pentium processor pentium processor includes new architectural feature well enhancement intel cpu new architectural feature superscalar architecture totally redesigned floating point unit fpu branch prediction separate code data cache write back cache mesi mutual exclusive shared invalid protocol multiprocessor support builtin data integrity increased reliability enhancement architecture include hardwired instruction enhanced microcode increased page size bit data bus pipelining q superscalar superscalar new pentium processor microarchitecture design technique allows multiple instruction executed simultaneously chip anology superscalar like adding another lane single lane highway car instruction go place time q branch prediction branch prediction new pentium processor another performance improvement technique since software execution incurs substantial delay branch point software instruction stream require branch new noncontiguous location system memory fetch next instruction inteldeveloped technology predict program going next actually begin working next instruction actually called upon q separate data instruction code cache two separate cache allows cpu fetch data code parallel doubling available cache bandwidth addition pentium processor large onchip data path large bit data cache dual access meaning two instruction read write data parallel complement
