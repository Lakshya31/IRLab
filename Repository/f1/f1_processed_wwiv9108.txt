bb software usually include game use dorinfodef rbbs qbbs remote access game use pcboardsys pcboard version game use doorsys wildcat  gap pcboard  game use callinfobbs preversion  wildcat game often

handle do interrupt especially true many game written pascal use wwiv sign sometimes do interrupt option set incorrectly game echo double character game viewable local mode remote mode may want experiment setting do interrupt option differently  shrink option many game necessitate bb shrink order run however experience  lock  freezing computer try run game may indication insufficient memory

wwiv require fossil driver order run wayne bell written io call comport however bb software requires fossil driver order operate author written program use fossil thus game may expect fossil present even though mentioned documentation game particularly true game written qbbs rbbs opus wwiv operate fine even fossil driver loaded fossil driver take k memory system tight memory may wish load fossil shrinking unload finish game may accomplished using exe com version fossil loaded unloaded batch file call game better known fossil driver x bnu opuscomm personally use bnu many wwiv system operator report excellent result x experience opuscom make claim however using bnu able get many game run would otherwise  comment regarding chain game written wwiv pascal presented uncompiled form author often done pascal code may altered customized board usually author made use something called commonpas file interface game wwiv particular game compiled must first compile appropriate version turbo pascal compiler using appropriate version commonpas version commonpas available downloading wwiv support board  brunxx game written quickbasic compiled utilize intermediate program called brun basic run time module game require brun module specific compiler current version brun brun brun brun brun program available wwiv support board brunxx file may placed path used program require one advantage
