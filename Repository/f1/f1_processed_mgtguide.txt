management protection automated information resource data process facility equipment personnel information manager area organization clearly accountable protection resource assigned enable perform duty responsible developing administering monitoring enforcing internal control including security control within assigned area authority manager specific responsibility vary depending role manager regard computer system portion document provide detailed information respective security responsibility manager computer resource manager responsible information system application personnel security issue involved however agency management must strive achieve costeffective security dollar spent security measure control contain loss never projected dollar loss something adverse happened information resource costeffective security result reduction risk implementation safeguard balanced cost greater value information processed severe consequence something happens greater need control measure protect person best determine value importance data functional manager responsible data example manager responsible agency budget program one establish requirement protection automated data support program manager know better anyone else organization impact data inaccurate unavailable additionally manager usually supervisor user data important tradeoff cost versus risk reduction explicitly considered management understand degree risk remaining selected control implemented assure operational continuity everincreasing demand timely information greater volume information processed threat information system disruption serious one case interruption hour unacceptable impact due inability process data assessed action taken assure availability system considered essential agency operation functional management must identify critical computer application develop contingency plan probability loss data processing telecommunication support minimized maintain integrity integrity information mean trust data process manipulate mean error omission minimized also information system protected deliberate action wrongfully change data information said integrity corresponds expectation assumption user assure confidentiality confidentiality sensitive data often always requirement agency system privacy requirement personal information dictated statute confidentiality agency information determined nature information eg information submitted bidder procurement action impact wrongful disclosure must considered understanding confidentiality requirement comply applicable law regulation risk vulnerability associated information system become better understood body law regulation compelling positive action protect information resource grows omb circular  management federal information resource  public law   computer security act  two document knowledge regulation law provide baseline information resource security program information system development section describes protective measure included part design development information processing application system functional manager responsible use information contained system must ensure security measure included adequate includes application designed personal computer well large mainframe control decision official responsible agency function served automated information system critical role making decision regarding security control past risk often unconsciously accepted individual assumed computer facility operator taking care security fact decision made security element provided delegated operator system many case user manager develops application operates solely cost control must balanced system efficiency usability issue risk must evaluated costeffective control selected provide prudent level control maximizing productivity control often closely connected system function effectively designed without significant understanding process automated security principle common security attribute present system process valuable personal sensitive information system design include mechanism enforce following security attribute identification authentication user user computer system unique identification system account number user identification code must also mean verifying individual claiming identity eg typing identifying code terminal really authorized individual imposter common mean authentication secret password known authorized user authorization capability enforcing principle least possible privilege beyond ensuring authorized individual access system also necessary limit user access information transaction capability person limited information transaction authority required job responsibility concept known principle least possible privilege longstanding control practice way easily assign user specific access authority needed individual accountability control legal point view necessary maintain record activity performed computer user requirement automated audit trail developed system designed information recorded depends significant particular system able hold individual accountable action must positive mean uniquely identifying computer user routinely maintained record user activity audit mechanism audit mechanism detect unusual event bring attention management commonly occurs violation reporting immediate warning computer system operator type alarm generated depends seriousness event common technique detect access attempt unauthorized individual count attempt security monitoring function system automatically keep track unsuccessful attempt gain access generate alarm attempt reach unacceptable number performance assurance basic design consideration information system ability verify system functioning intended system developed without design consideration often difficult independently audit review leading possibility unintended result inaccurate processing recoverability federal agency potentially heavily dependent computer system important design consideration ability easily recover troublesome event whether minor problem major disruption system design point view system designed easily recover minor problem either transportable another backup computer system replaced manual process case major disruption loss computer facility access decision automated system ready use decision must made regarding access system information contains example many individual require ability access view data ability change delete data even computer system designed provide ability narrowly designate access authority knowledgeable responsible official must actually make access decision care taken process major determining factor level security control present system sensitive data transmitted unprotected line intercepted passive eavesdropping occur encrypting file make data unintelligible port protection device protect file unauthorized access warranted system development process information system software developed controlled systematic manner according agency standard quality efficiency data processed possible reconfiguration system affected inadequate development process risk security
