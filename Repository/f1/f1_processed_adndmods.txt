alternate system ad forward began attempt  fix  ad system make playable soon found task impossible without trashing almost everything system starting scratch obsolete concept  class  built restriction weapon armor spell skill  list go unacceptable obvious people skill based system many advantage class based one one happy see ad ver  take step right direction  adding nonweapon proficiency however half step cause fall current nwp system give  feel  skill based system still holding ardently class based root obvious solution play something skill based gurps example goal set making change system goal mind first felt current magic system much tendency low level spellcasters  johnny one shot  cast one spell done day higher level spell caster quite large selection spell quite powerful flexibility level mage example could still cast magic missile finished day increased effect spell fireball level without additional cost caster also bothered second detested weapon armor restriction ca nt mage wield sword gandalf astute student point realize restriction imposed  balance  game  limitation class based system ca nt rogue use long bow wear plate armor want lastly nt like hit point system system describes hit point combination luck physical punishment potential note may true nt bothered track exact quote obviously pseudojustification left war gaming day next several section

accumulated luck luck point health character exactly equal constitution use following rule generate health score monster whose constitution known roll appropriate number dice depending size creature tiny small medium large huge gargantuan note intended represent constitution creature general luck character given hit dice level exactly equal hit point old system damage come first luck point represents small scratch bruise like example third level fighter constitution would health score luck point fighter still gain higher amount luck point combat due high constitution class negative health score character reach zero health fall ground barely conscious able crawl  bind wound drink potion little else make successful willpower check roll wisdomcurrent health check must made round example fighter take massive wound bringing health  must roll wisdom remain conscious round unlike regular ad character die  health instead character finally receives aid priest example must take current health divide maximum health round fraction successful roll system shock table equate maximum health constitution finding system shock roll add point divided number result loss life say fighter reach  health whatever reason priest attend must roll divided  le percentile regardless health character die maxhealth berserker creature gone berserk whatever reason fight enemy dead died make willpower roll fight dead ie maxhealth make berserker cursed item cause berserking much deadly healing since luck point really wound allow healing magic sort act doubly point healing heals point
