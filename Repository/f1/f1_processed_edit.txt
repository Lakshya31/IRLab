philadelphia pa   electronic deception interception terrorism radio shack reality š                                     objective scope problem use personal computer growth electronics mainstream population allow almost anyone basic understanding common technology possible interception collection information would available normal condition supplier basic electronic equipment provide number different device unknown number possibility interception telecommunication data communication microwave satellite communication small price equipment advertised small dime may purchased back many electronic magazine  device bit larger need expertise operate still hand many add entry personal computer ability collect million bit data second instead human needing ingest store information information collected onto tape floppy disk removed safer location ease compared removal volume information paper book form problem involved possible comprimised condition include outside data

information available anyone computer communication ability threat incident occurring increase tenfold reason due ease access anyone right information available call outlet sensitive knowledge statement thomas jefferson represents spirit word  knowledge power  frightning truth today information society  electronic deception interception terrorism radio shack reality                                     result date continued expansion computer many individual group brought attention law enforcement authority group name legion doom knight shadow gang brotherhood ohm others group consist minor trade information number computer telecommunication system individual become known due action system choice reason discovery include blatant posting plan attack system piecedtogether information telephone company record credit card fraud committed obtain computer hardware software system security violated numerous time outside telecom contact group small impact overall communication insecurity pose little threat national corporate security major problem associated leak sensitive knowledge come lack true indicator incursion network person little directed intent able gather sensitive data number public underground source directed force much easier time gathering fact building upon fact gathering ability come eastern bloc country representives country using  listening

interception terrorism radio shack reality                                     result date co nt common sense applied one must assume goverment using encryption method transmit information communication channel one benefit method allow useful lifetime information remain valid well keeping information guarded unauthorized source since information secured easy desemenation value interception decrease point ability decipher information becomes costly time value stance one interesting twist encryption method used public goverment agency use de digital encryption standard de encryption method endorsed federal goverment use public domain method currently protected disclosure outside u selected nato country classified  material war  method introduced secure method encryption information possibility correct information decoded one  chance odds ignored prove formidable unauthorized access exception major goverments method adopted commerical sector deployed number year multiple site little hesitation user user confidence quite high method question must raised release method public domain since method secured decryption time value stance according goverment information method hand public possible method accessible trap door imbedded allow inspection encrypted information would federal goverment release method secure hand general public even could read information method recertified goverment usefulness technique reached saturation point time needed decrypt information become matter hour day instead reported year weakness de system shown number

produced easily commercially produced chip  electronic deception interception terrorism radio shack reality                                     continuing development activity addition increased skill person directed intent able obtain knowledge invasion network system allows penetration system ease individual seeking way gain entry little detection involved may using underground source information roadmaps target entry planned used fullest possible extent without owner system wiser computer communication facility attacked vast group computer literate person seeking information challenge available normal data processing environment people seeking connection system answer allow connection general public fed constant diet computer communication society whole undergoing major reeducation
