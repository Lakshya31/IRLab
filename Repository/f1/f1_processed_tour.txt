anyone us dir want able use simple instead c do alias dir see alias defined enter alias parameter c do alias ddir use alias enter name prompt like command case see standard directory display c do defined alias use anywhere command used prompt batch file inside another alias example build alias already defined suppose regularly use column directory listing discussed near start tour define alias execute dir  command touch couple key since already defined define separately us alias choose one method try c do alias dir  c do alias  use alias type command press enter pas file name alias like

executed also create key alias nt execute press key type additional information line  use single sign start alias instead two use alias redefine standard command work without changing name suppose always want dir display output column vertical sort pause end page might think using something like c do alias dir dir pv go ahead try dir get error c do dir alias loop c do  alias loop  error caused dir command inside alias interpreted another attempt run alias easy change alias doesnt happen c do alias dir dir pv indicates follows interpreted alias try definition scroll back incorrect definition
