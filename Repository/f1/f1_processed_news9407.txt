consider date probably creative wwiv modder remember logging wwiv v multinodal conferenced system always kept modification thats people nt know learned c helped lot learned c modification wwiv reading

everyone else started installing modification mod net asking help first release never work nt changed much eventually released first modification like many people mine printed sub name read prompt stuff like learned order release good popular modification need following thing experience knowledge imagination determination patience without attribute nt even worth starting step brainstorming first step modification process probably important use brain think something original modification already exists want better everyone else way many people like might take existing code previously released modification try optimize way started think waste time start scratch modification already existence want accomplish give credit author original modification time think want draw paper draw see look like called  brainstorming  stage mind sketch wish time start course small survey might help usually modification look thing already existence either wwiv bb software try come mod thing mod nt exist problem write function step body work almost war finally get learn c usually attribute stated earlier start need experience nt know wwiv internal function personal hell nt programming

modification people emailing tell nt okay nt right get email forgot space somewhere people trying help course get mail people thanking people shout ca nt mod without problem everybody satisfied choice get depressed forget keep go next level  step revision popular mod stay around forever revision beginning bug fix mod author get good mail people using mod really feel better might put smile face

wwiv promote people idea listen see optimize coding maybe day come someone else something pretty similar better work day question continue try better support help like seeing listplus think people
