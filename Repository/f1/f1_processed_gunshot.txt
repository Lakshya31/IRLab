gunshot primer residue invisible clue roger w aaron special agent fbi laboratory washington dc early morning armed robbery convenience store sole clerk shot suspect arrested minute later several block away without weapon hand however gunshot primer residue gsr invisible clue could used investigator crime involving firearm unfortunately many instance valuable evidence would made available investigator juror various reason including unfamiliarity proper procedure collecting gsr analysis article address strength weakness process offer suggestion effective use often overlooked evidence background explosion inside firing cartridge burn gunpowder completely analytical technique yet developed consistently identifies remaining trace quantity unburned powder hand clothing shooter however several procedure accomplish tried year first attempt associate individual firearm hand coated film paraffin order lift residual nitrite residue could visualized diphenylamine procedure abandoned year ago however nitrite provide sufficient specificity large deposit necessary yield adequate color development still even today many investigator erroneously refer  paraffin test  discussing modern gunshot primer residue analysis continued investigation application neutron activation analysis identified two noncombustible primer mixture component barium antimony detectable residue discharge ammunition discovery led reliable test available law enforcement community today procedure common analytical protocol cotton swab moistened diluted nitric acid wiped web palm area hand neutron activation analysis naa atomic absorption spectroscopy aa used determine quantity barium antimony swab area hand since neither barium antimony unique gsr necessary find element amount within range found hand person known recently fired weapon control group another method technician use adhesive disk pick microscopic particle gsr hand scanning electron microscope sem equipped conduct energy dispersive xray analysis edxa used detect particle containing barium antimony semedxa produce visual image particle thereby providing analyst useful size shape information additionally barium antimony shown occur specifically within particle opposed part general background contamination technique gained support recent year due development automated system simplify eliminate much lengthy tedious searching process variation combination method however rely least part finding barium antimony presumptive evidence gsr collecting evidence gunshot primer residue much like chalk hand school teacher using blackboard minute teacher walk away board chalk loss start mechanical action rubbing hand together putting pocket rubbing clothing handling object therefore officer instructed collect gsr evidence immediately upon making arrest generally little hope finding adequate quantity barium antimony associate individual weapon hour normal hand activity washing hand remove essentially gsr deposit unfortunately ideal gsr collection procedure odds fundamental precept immediately handcuffing arrestees hand behind back cuffing procedure greatly decrease amount gsr outer web hand pressed body improper procedure addressed arresting officer crime scene personnel since could lead elimination contamination potentially valuable evidence gsr collection kit available police supply store catalog deceptively simple appearance kit implies acceptable substitute made standard drugstore item however practice introduce multiple error collection process error avoided using collection kit questionnaire prepared commercially knowledgeable laboratory personnel important point real value gsr test associate individual firearm important however note identify person shooter gsr settle hand placed near weapon fired person pick gsr simply handling dirty weapon discharged ammunition component also possible unlikely residue would deposited hand mean thus placing individual environment gsr generally put person presence firearm time failure find gsr hand mean person tested handle fire weapon example many test firing controlled condition fbi laboratory deposit sufficient quantity material allow identification firearm may produce deposit five consecutive firing sixth weapon may simply sufficiently dirty handled enough effect transfer noted earlier gsr could deposited later removed washing normal use hand finding inconclusive amount barium antimony simply mean analyst offer opinion value associating tested individual firearm situation analogous fingerprint analyst opinion concerning particular person presence crime scene print analysis inconclusive test using neutron activation analysis naa atomic absorption spectroscopy aa determining total barium antimony sample constitute unequivocal identification gsr elevated level element found sample result reported consistent obtained person known discharged firearm unlikely possible get independent environmental contamination element one four specimen collected person tested barium antimony found trace amount hand uncommon detect elevated level sample nonshooters hand recent study fbi laboratory analyzed sample hand person near firearm set hand sample analyzed percent significantly elevated level element eliminated consistent gsr parameter relevant gsr test analysis gsr victim little value suicidehomicide situation used routinely victim investigative tool gunshot residue go weapon barrel bullet escape near handle victim close range shooting attempt grab gun instinctively shield head significant deposit left hand laboratory analysis reliably determine whether deposit made manner result selfdirected firing likewise suspect crime scene sampled admit otherwise associated weapon approximate time shooting person returned hunting trip claim struggled victim assailant weapon shooting example generally tested gsr accurate identification gsr largely depends prior experience laboratory performing analysis determine expected specific area hand handling weapon information generally available except specifically defined studied area hand thus surface automobile window clothing part body specific area hand usually suitable gsr examination several factor affect analysis unfamiliar surface including environmental barium antimony contamination potential previous exposure gsr latter concern significant gsr volatile generally remain surface mechanically removed thus gsr clothing suspected shooter explained person handling weapon wearing garment several week earlier conclusion detection gunshot primer residue hand individual confirms person environment material within hour preceding collection sample would likely result firing weapon handling weapon ammunition close proximity weapon discharged another person failure detect gsr hand indicates test offer information value determining whether individual presence material exception welldefined situation nothing inferred result gsr test avoid useless analysis officer collect sample person associated recently firearm witness hand washed hour elapsed since shooting ammunition used shooting contain barium antimony setting parameter save time eliminates much misunderstanding confusion surrounding gsr test like analytical process certain condition must exist ensure useful gsr analysis
