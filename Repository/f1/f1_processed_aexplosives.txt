existing explosive fall one category somewhere follows listing category brief description example propellant propellant low explosive combustible material containing within oxygen needed combustion burn explode function producing gas explodes example black powder smokeless powder ii primary explosive primary explosive initiator sometimes called explode detonate heated subjected shock burn sometimes even contain element necessary combustion material explode explosion result whether confined brisance shock produce explode differs considerably different explosive sensitivity heat amount heat give example mercury fulminate lead azide fulminating gold mixture red phosphorus potassium chlorate copper acetylide nitrogen sulfide tetracene iii high explosive high explosive detonate influence shock explosion suitable primary explosive function burning ignited flame though small amount generally burn tranquilly extinguished easily heated high temperature external heat combustion sometimes explode generally brisant powerful primary explosive exert mechanical effect whatever near explode whether confined example dynamite trinitrotoluene tetryl picric acid nitrocellulose
