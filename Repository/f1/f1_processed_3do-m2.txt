unveils bit technology new york  business wire  may  company today unveiled highly anticipated nextgeneration technology bit architecture designed create quantum leap advanced cd entertainment technology leveraging highend image sound processor ibm motorola powerpc microprocessor technology rival image quality performance workstation popular arcade machine  quantum leap industry graphic speed quality  said trip hawkins president ceo  raising bar  performance breakthrough designed architecture deliver breakthrough processing performance highest quality graphic digital video consumer interactive entertainment software  polygon performance alone phenomenal  said hugh martin chief operating officer  easily beat many expensive graphic workstation outpaces popular coinop arcade system advanced graphic video sound capability powerful bit architecture enable software developer create title provide whole new level realism engaging experience previously available advanced cd entertainment system  based revolutionary custom graphic sound io processor designed ibm powerpc tm microprocessor specially designed interactive application mind architecture process one million polygon per second multiple processor dedicated specific task optimize superior image quality performance processor supported powerful system resource technology provides including bit data bus megabit memory memory subsystem capable delivering megabyte per second mpeg digital video decompression technology also designed core architecture builtin vhsquality digital video capability  superior price performance powerpc enabling new class advanced home entertainment software  said phil hester general manager system technology architecture division ibm  working together defined unique capability make best possible technology interactive entertainment application bit system architecture forever change way people play learn interact  highly integrated architecture developed ground result working world leading processor graphic audio system designer  ibm motorola world class manufacturing process allow u achieve superior performance higher integration  said hawkins  powerpc microprocessor custom processor processor family offer truly nextgeneration performance  beyond bit revolutionary image quality performance feature enable development interactive entertainment software provides unprecedented level realism richly detailed interactive world containing multiple complex character photorealistic image high frame rate vhsquality video theatrequality sound interactive software experience radically better anything consumer familiar today  capability demonstrated today go far beyond anything currently available market development advanced cd entertainment market  said martin  feature like gouraud shading filtered texture perspective correction complex scene requiring performance hundred thousand polygon per second take gamers whole new dimension realism fun   first system delivered best interactive entertainment experience home  added hawkins  set standard  time bit advanced cd entertainment experience  advanced graphic video feature technology designed enable software company provide consumer complex photorealistic world character full motion digital video mixed computergenerated graphic move seamlessly enable software company develop interactive entertainment title offer lifelike graphic tremendous speed considerably action previously possible interactive title architecture includes several key feature achieving breakthrough image quality performance feature built performed hardware enable software developer easily efficiently provide richer sophisticated graphic image engaging entertainment experience software designer simply apply advanced effect image technology rest work  gouraud shading lighting  technology allows designer apply significant number lighting effect object scene light source reflected realistically object based light source relation object gouraud shading applied object create appropriate color shadow scene result image scenery brilliantly curved smooth surface  texture mapping  texture mapping used apply graphic texture polygonbased model give modelled object desired look texture mapping capability render polygon delivering million pixel per second support wide range data type including video  filtering  filtering process used make object texture appear smoother natural averaging softening image pixel edge filtering creates realistic image using simpler geometry  mip mapping  mip mapping used provide smooth texture appearance object move closer farther away scene mip mapping system dynamically us different level texture detail based object distance camera image appear scale smoothly maintain visual clarity regardless camera distance yet original texture needed  zbuffer twodimensional world described two ax x horizontal vertical threedimensional world add third axis z allows object placed anywhere within threedimensional space one object sits front second object z dimension tell system object relative others zbuffer manages complex object intersecting dynamically enables automatic hidden surface calculation system automatically know given visual perspective user see therefore polygon render example car drive front tree system automatically determines need render portion tree hidden behind car zbuffering provided hardware coinop arcade machine workstation system allow zbuffering occur software zbuffering provides big performance gain using complex graphic model  perspective correction  perspective correction take z dimension account mapping texture polygon technology automatically modifies texture scene appear proper perspective based user interaction result fewer artifact simpler geometry competing system  transparency  transparency enables complex image special effect built simple geometric model architecture also provides alpha channel support enables software designer control level transparency model pixel pixel real time instance one large polygon drawn texture mapped transparency applied appropriate pixel create desired effect  hardwarebased mpeg video decompression  technology designed builtin mpeg video decompression provide vhsquality digital video capability addition using digital video decompression playback treat decompressed video like type data advanced technique enables designer apply decompressed running video object like texture feature hardware video effect capability machine costing many thousand dollar additionally multiple stream digital video incorporated title one time software development environment software design expertise developing bit title scalable new architecture part technology strategy taken advantage current operating system development tool minimize development learning curve company leveraged migrated many critical component bit platform development environment development environment including core operating system enhanced new graphic function enable software company produce title faster easily developing first title new architecture product design system architecture designed provide hardware partner flexibility produce product meet variety consumer need including addon upgrade current interactive multiplayer customer well integrated standalone system  first market bit system others adopted concept product  said hawkins  nobody else anything like  company expects announce hardware software partner specific product launch plan later date based redwood city calif company nasdaq thdo develops license advanced interactive technology hardware software company worldwide company awardwinning product design bit interactive multiplayer system created deliver breakthrough interactive entertainment affordable price also develops publishes distributes cdrom software product peripheral system current system
