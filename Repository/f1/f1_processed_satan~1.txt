u doe computer incident advisory capability                     number  march order provide timely useful information upcoming release satan tool ciac releasing special issue ciac note please send comment feedback ciac llnlgov reference specific commercial product necessarily constitute imply endorsement recommendation favoring ciac university california united state government look satan john fisher ciac team ciac llnlgov introduction security administrator tool analyzing network satan tool investigating vulnerability remote system systematically moving given internet subdomain probe weakness responding system vulnerability uncovered reported user due released april satan joint work dan farmer author cop computer oracle password system wietse venema eindhoven university technology netherlands project private effort part final product freely available anyone internet although nt hit internet yet satan guaranteed large impact security satan promoted security tool system administrator attack tool cracker unfortunately utilized either manner system administrator decide impact safety particular system dependent utilizes satan first searching system vulnerability new idea cop report many common vulnerability single system analyzing system resides tool probe vulnerability remote system new idea either internet security scanner i written christopher klaus available public commerical version several year certainly simplified probing remote system public version particularly powerful lacked user interface provided limited set attack contrast satan considerably powerful utilizes world wide web www client provide friendly point click interface extensive information provided explains vulnerability identified vulnerability removed work information provided relates version  beta release satan made hypertext markup language html document c code perl script generate html code dynamically requires html viewer mosaic netscape lynx c compiler perl version user simply interacts www client entering necessary data form control panel satan provides four hypertext option target selection reporting data analysis documentation configuration administration target selection user enter machine domain machine attack extent attack light normal heavy light attack simply report host available remote procedure call rpc service offer normal attack probe target establishing finger telnet ftp www gopher smtp connection used establish operating system vulnerability may available heavy attack additionally search several known vulnerability writable anonymous ftp directory trusted host target extent probing established simple mouse click begin analysis finished user find result reporting data analysis link satan highly customizable extendible configuration file numerous default value modified new probe performed host may added writing program script proper input output naming extension  satan  allow user write attack tool add satan plugandplay manner protecting satan attack configuring system correctly installing latest patch monitoring system usage satan technique countered minimum detected unfortunately complete protection satan difficult vulnerability look easily addressable yet satisfactory solution course configuration problem addressed immediately uncovered serious vulnerability may addressed stopping vulnerable service placing firewall around vulnerable set host summary vulnerability satan exploit chiefly borrowed satan documentation effectively addressing vulnerability system administrator prevent attack unprivaleged nfs access nfs suffers poor authentication algorithm standard authentication mechanism us authunix us uid gid pair authorize nfs request legitimate nfs request may spoofed user program fooling nfs granting file access arbitrary user although special authentication done authunix root privilege filesystem may obtained well easy problem fix course make sure nfs security patch installed best bet find new implementation nfs one support de encryption utilizes authdes authorization partial solution configure nfs request accepted privileged system program making spoofing difficult user must least

nfs file system exported via portmapper bsd system portmap used convert tcpip protocol port number rpc program number host gain access another host file system tricking portmapper making nfs request nfs trust portmapper one could gain access exported file system since exported file system user home directory vulnerability used stepping stone gaining root access several step taken avoid vulnerability first portmapper used forward mount request host bsd system wietse venema written secure portmapper available ftp ftpwintuenlpubsecurityportmapsharz system v based system similar tool

ni password file access arbitrary host ni network information server provides user information including encrypted password host network unfortunately little host authentication performed easy external host obtain user password information password cracker used obtain login best solution update ni provide complete access control mechanism unfortunately vendor providing yet portmapper tighter access control mechanism may work well several patch ni running sunos discussed ciac bulletin c strongly enforced policy good password probably important secure ni several passwd alternative
