 pcohio main bulletin   benefit mnp david terry salt air bb three benefit discus mnp v since benefit reason mnp v provides error corrected session modem modem end phone line ever logged onto system found could barely read write message due line noise  appreciate difference  clean line   noisy line  modem mnp v capable filtering line noise make mistake line noise may still  get printed screen host screen modem filtered  filtering process  similar error correction protocol xmodem ymodem send block data crc together receiving modem find different crc value two modem resend data corrected manner file transfered ymodem pretty much guaranteed  correct  arrives even though line noise may caused several resends data true data see screen using error correcting modem second benefit mnp v creating data packet  error correction protocol  able reduce size data stripping start stop bit instance normal character take bit plus start bit stop bit total bit basis figure bit per second modem give maximum throughput character per second character bit long mnp v protocol strip start stop bit subtracts data give increase speed minus percentage point protocol overhead therefore without even compressing data expect see much character per second bps line versus  norm  cps line third benefit mnp v data compression bb world probably aware file arced ziped reason using arc zip decrease size file storing disk uncompress file want use save disk storage performing file transfer also save time data compression capability mnp v nearly good either arc zip straight ascii text still capable decreasing data size decreasing mean double throughput line bps modem effectively transmit cps speed bps modem drawback  get benefit mnp v modem end also mnp v built data compression modem effective data transferred already compressed mean expect see fast transfer ascii text file transferring file already compressed arc zip file actually slower modem perform data compression unfortunately bb world compressed data common noncompressed data sure able read message faster move eye fast download bulletin noncompressed data faster downloads file bb actually slower fortunately usually tell modem turn data compression prior making phone call slow file transfer high speed modem david terry salt air bb following text basically discus u robotics hst bps modem hayes vseries bps modem also cover subject v modem old usr hst top transmission speed bps taking account kind mnp compression typical throughput old hst ranged cps compressed file modemcompressiondisabled cps regular text file modemcompressionenabled hst transmit bps connected another hst connect  baud standard modem new usr hst termed able transmit data bps taking account mnp compression etc typical throughput new hst range  cps compressed file modemcompressiondisabled  cps text file modemcompressionenabled  assuming youve opened comm port bps hst transmit bps connected another hst connect  baud standard modem hayes vseries modem similar old usr hst described typically see throughput high cps text file cps compressed file hayes vseries transmit bps connected another vseries modem connect  baud standard modem hayes recently begun shipping vseries modem new rom chip giving v compatibility mean vseries modem provide errorcorrected session connected regular mnp modem bps v implement mnp level excludes mnp compression typically see throughput  cps bps line due mnp stripping start stop bit v modem made u robotics multitech run bps give similar throughput described ie v give slower transmission speed new hst running described however advantage v provides better  interactive response time  typing v ccitt  standard  connect bps modem made manufacturer   mean connect u robotics v multitech v v v standard appears one remain time come purchasing v modem may better investment concerned future compatibility however v still cost proprietary standard hst vseries usr dual standard v hst modem  hst mode  everything said new hst true  v mode  everything said v modem true word v mode get full speed advantage dual standard file transfer however one big advantage dual standard compatible v standard existing hst modem well v vbis v vbis  enough drive crazy david terry salt air bb many v pronounced vee dot standard get confused thinking even confused try pronounced sentence going attempt explain standard hope clearing air surrounding topic v standard v standard  modulation  standard like compare fm standard used radio broadcasting different frequency use different modulation technique different modulation standard baud v standard full duplex data going way simultaneously rated speed standard bps connection vbis  bi  mean simply enhanced v standard modem incorporating vbis capable transmitting data bps standard also higher bps standard like slower v speed data move direction simultaneously rated speed v v standard error correction standard method data packetized sent modem ensure data arrives receiving end transmitted mnp another error correction standard fact v standard includes mnp  alternate  method case modem v compliant  word v modem connect mnp modem achieve  reliable  connection vbis enhanced v yes vbis standard add high level data compression error correcting facility built v standard example ascii text file k length could transmitted compressed k making  reduction size receiving side transmitted data expanded original k size effect transfer rate modem double triple even quadruple rated speed connection compressing data transmitting uncompressing end noted type data compression useful downloading ascii file bulletin message etc useless downloading zip arc file already compressed v v together commonly asked question v modem work v answer yes asked question  transmit english fm radio frequency listener understand  answer would virtually reason likening v method packetizing data english v method modulation fm radio transmission v v standard two completely different complimentary area communication fact likely discover every v modem find v mnp kind error correction control built combined together modem vbis higher transmission speed vbis greater compression ability fast transmitting receiving data example v modem raw throughput bps would deliver cps adding v brings cps data compressible compression capability vbis could see even greater speed time greater depending data compressed vbis modem raw throughput bps delivers cps adding v brings cps data compression possible achieve time speed depending compressibility data
