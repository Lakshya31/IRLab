thoroughly starting anything pyrotechnic preparation explosive nature unstable subject ignition explosion heat shock friction clear understanding dangerous property due care handling ingredient finished product necessary accident avoided always observe possible precaution particularly following mix small batch one time mean gram ounce nt go big mix  make bigger accident power explosive cube every ounce ounce time powerful one ounce weighing chemical use clean piece paper scale pan item discard used paper bucket water weighing next ingredient safe worker dispose chemical spilled workbench equipment weighing nt keep open container chemical table since accidental spillage mixing may occur finished container close replace storage shelf use clean equipment chemical ground grind separately never together thoroughly wash clean equipment grinding another ingredient mixing batch done outdoors away flammable structure building barn garage etc mix also made non metallic container avoid spark glass also used since shatter case accident handy small container made cutting top plastic bottle three four inch bottom mix may conveniently made placing ingredient plastic bottle rolling around

flat surface rolling across sheet lifting side corner one time never ram tamp mix paper cardboard tube pour material gently tap shake tube settle content store ingredient finished mix fire hazard away heat flame finished preparation may stored plastic bottle shatter case accident since many ingredient mix poisonous stored reach child pet preferably locked away sure thread screw top container cap thoroughly cleaned applies also container stopper rubber cork type closure trace mixture caught container closure may ignited friction opening closing container throughout procedure work clean condition always wear face shield least shatterproof safety glass careful worker handling dangerous material sure lens frame flammable always wear dust respirator handling chemical dust form small particle gather lung stay may cause serious illness later life always wear glove working chemical always wear waterproof lab apron must work indoors good ventilation system never smoke anywhere near working make sure open flame present motor produce spark inside hot water heater furnace pilot light stove spark known readily explode dust floating air always work someone two head better one source water readily available fire extinguisher hose etc never circumstance use metal load chemical put chemical firework metal casing worse handle live hand grenade never use metal container includes dangerous co cartridge many people killed flying fragment metal casing please use metal circumstance always thoroughly familiar chemical using information included file look whatever extra information

screen create spark cause fire explosion seems amazing anyone would want push flammable explosive chemical screen bare hand bring another concern avoid metal tool wherever possible might circumstance
