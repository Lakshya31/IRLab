acceptable revision official ad nd edition combat system whenever save v spell poison whatever must rolled failure mean instant death save die roll changed failure mean hit point damage two obligatory system shock survival roll failure one two roll mean character died provided course hit point damage nt killed already character suffers massive damage  hit point single attack also roll system shock survival roll survive save v death magic life energy level used encounter undead spell drain experience level see appendix b twohanded use weapon normally used singlehandedly imposes tohit penalty give damage bonus proficiency specifically taken twohanded use weapon eliminates tohit penalty critical hit resolved like critical hit mean attack done normal maximum damage player may add character maximum damage weapon result implies player may roll another repeated time rolled sum value eg thief strength damage  wielding long sword  specialized twice  damage roll attack ogre maximum damage  player roll come roll roll superb attack  hit point damage fumble divided three case fumble saving throw v magic kind fumble attacking fumble ability check fumble saving throw mean character particularly unlucky spell normally deal damage eg fireball character take extra damage equal one half one quarter save original damage spell deal damage character still take damage sideeffects eg stumbling dislocating elbow spell took effect extra damage utterly unlikely eg casting sleep somebody already sleeping naturally soft bed none fumble attacking mean character totally miscalculated swingthrow character take hit point damage eg tripping hitting table cutting oneself spraining wrist ankle come another must rolled procedure last character dead another number come value must summed fumble ability check dealt case case basis often involve extra ability check versus dexterity see bad maneuver damage determined combat round minute replaced combat segment second fight take le time game time speed factor weapon indicates amount second take deal blow weapon similarly casting time spell indicates number second take cast spell except spell casting time round turn still take minute minute cast spell thus impractical midst combat problem duration spell duration segment would make spell nearly worthless solved far combatrelated spell eg hold person duration segment whereas others retain duration round remaining problem treated case case basis occur change inspired hectic swordplay one see fantasy movie fact unrealistic wizard cast short spell eg power word stun allowed anything else round combat segment problem alleviated spellcasters hardly time something else new combat segment begin character multiple attack weapon fight monster character whose attack come time eg clawclawbite fighting weapon hand order attack determined way roll intiative two party add respective weapon speed divide sum two three fighter  attack character multiple attack find first attack take place second attack come normal time eg th level fighter specialized long sword two attack per segment battle cleric wielding mace initiative roll fighter cleric combined weapon speed give fighter  cleric  still fighter get first attack   order segment thus fighter  cleric fighter note cleric used dagger would attacked fighter got attack initiative weapon speed used twohanded sword single attack would come last round also note character spellcasting lose dexterity bonus addition official rule reminder new concept body point used case sleeping immobilised magically held character attacked character body point score maximum amount hit point first level hit point considered character ability take physical damage hit point gained later due experience ie knowing take le damage attack slay character defend one need bring body point  slowly bleed death  attacker quicken process course moreover attack helpless creature considered automatic critical hit cfr supra weapon maximum damage possibly rolled extra damage given combat segment used thing become realistic eg immobilised character hit point say fighter con rolled hit point st level  body point attacker dagger body point damage roll critical segment character brought body point hit point matter probably die next round attacker inflict maximum damage dagger roll monster also body point score equal twice hit die plus bonus hit point instance troll  hit die body point storm giant hit die  hit point storm giant thus still difficult kill single blow realistic given size volume creature even sword stuck deep chest damage part huge heart improves official optional rule allows one kill sleeping held creature one attack entire party attacked helpless storm giant single segment however would probably prove lethal
