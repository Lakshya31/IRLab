script language like english use word build sentence word classified verb adjective etc script language use basic set element build sentence script language contains following basic element keywords token constant variable structure statement function procedure comment let look one turn keywords keyword word special meaning script language change spelling meaning keyword game system specific meaning depends meaning primary keyword equivalent verb english language indicates action taking place keywords form basis script language example goto write etc secondary keyword exists complement primary keyword meaning example primary keyword four secondary keywords associated namely elsif else endif example playername  henry  fighting write  go away  endif line write keywords primary endif secondary meaning relation keyword note also secondary keyword nothing didnt highlight function keyword used examine modify system value value meaning game system examine sometimes modify change way system behaves example keyword fighting previous example true value game system currently combat mode fight taking place script display word go away current player name henry fighting note word player npc object world group etc called variable qualifier like playername worldlandscape called attribute covered elsewhere manual section writing script manual introduces keywords using simple example detailed description keyword found script language reference guide list primary secondary function keywords comment comment sequence character beginning character exclamation point tell script language compiler text follows comment ignored comment used document script easier understand example comment also comment another comment note text following first part comment including character number number important dcgames used extensively identify attribute object character rule number value  true constant using number usually restrict within range value allowed purpose using number example ring object attribute called charge hold number time ring used attribute value charge left trying set charge attribute result warning message assign maximum allowed value range value attribute take documented along attribute section entitled structure chapter token write script frequently need examine modify attribute object character perform different action depending value attribute numeric nt need remember number mean instead token defined represent numeric value document token shown upper case name shown upper case letter considered token example standard product includes set predefined object type food weapon armor etc game us number represent object type etc would difficult remember want create weapon need set object type thus token namely weapon used complete list predefined token value usage found appendix modify extend set predefined element type also add new token file dcctokendat associate token name actual value going represent name added file longer remember value using new type class whatever variable variable name used represent value like token difference variable hold value value modified example object could weight change value time variable

lost every time script start execution local variable initialized zero variable used mostly control purpose hold intermediate value global variable named g g variable hold value   called global exist entire duration game set one variable certain value retain value change variable used hold value important throughout life game example might use one variable indicate certain action taken place script could check value variable take different action depending whether action taken place string variable string variable named different variable hold text instead number also different used

another description entirely correct control script call object curritem script needed script may call others like casting script descobj script need given object behave differently need write separate script script need handle action object one different example want create magic ring ring cast one spell could write special script entry point wear action see programming guide section end document character wear ring script might display image genie ask player spell desired script would perform appropriate spell remember script entry point given action default action taken case default action call curritem script thus action would handled curritem script except wear remember also script end continue instead stop default action taken anyway script doesnt really handle situation example ring may random effect ie never know going happen wear script would set ring class determines magical effect terminate continue default action would taken curritem script would handle actual magical effect world script world script executed whenever enter exit world default world script worlddefscr invoked world script world type attribute configured using dcworld allow worlddef script
