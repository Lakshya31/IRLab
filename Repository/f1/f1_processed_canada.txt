larger population likely usa many many sighting never obtained nsrc sampling technique nsrc study revealed essentially reversed monthly distribution ufo report compared canada whereas u sighting peaked winter noticeable trough summer canadian peak traditionally summer however canadian distribution much even peak winter summer grouping two study together yield monthly distribution trough

distribution much uniform american data monthly distribution peak march september october peak evident canadian data like canadian study american data unevenly distributed throughout country american
