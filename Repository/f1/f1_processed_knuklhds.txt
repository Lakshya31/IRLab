attack aurora wait computer leap air execute auroracharged attack thus nailing computer air christine easiest one pull trick probably followed takeshi gregory hard claudia right aerial opponent computer le likely set low energy though charge aurora jump towards opponent still charged still holding button release button midair pouncing opponent execute powerful aerial attack really hurt possibly even knock nt block block attack might possibly followed christine lightning staff special attack simply couple quick low attack remember energy meter deceptive damaged opponent le successive attack injure balancing feature make easier opponent recover losing half energy tends put outcome fight doubt someone stretched ground cliche  ai nt never till  note matchup  best two three  format sf ii although quite similar replenished two heart beginning every matchup lose heat game time run battle go fighter energy case double knockout draw  winner  battle participant lose heart two participant lose last heart time game v cpu claudia charge aurora simultaneously blocking colcovard drop release high aurora attack nail rebound v cpu christine lot low attack especially youre using claudia v cpu gregory blat mix strategy liberally v takeshi rob rely upon strategy defensive unless tell throw fireball jump nail em v computer endurance match  remember two cpu fighter hurt one another trick get trapped get trapped try escape throwing one special move strike side  sidestepping  away try trap one keep trapped pounding relentlessly quick low attack thrown one opponent standing nearby chance throw moment fall back strategy else fails try spinning defensive special attack computer intelligent match tends charge lot tick computer sometimes especially air attack course computer also tick back ticking usually effective golden doppelganger though quick low attack correct timing spacing often cut special attack many special attack christine  hai toh go  charge gregory  anger beast  etc leave computer human vulnerable thrown blocked throw executed right time golden doppelganger also called  midas man  last cpu opponent shape shifter unlike geegus shang tsung true form never seen also unlike geegus shang tsung never  morphs  different form oneonone battle always maintains shape whoever currently dealing assume none must fight new person one wish battle golden doppelganger one must first take five fighter survive three  endurance match  two cpu fighter v player oneself second player join time process one progress erased one must start beginning doppelganger greatest strength deadly fast attack special technique whoever impersonates pattern reach  health although easy weaken tough defeat quote whatever character fight usually say strategy christine myao  learn anticipate doppelganger suddenly spring skating attack leap forward right time knock move preferably aerial aura attack also learn anticipate charging attack block either counter throw timing right use special attack risk although lightning staff effective careful close keep long watch spinning shield jump match may nd easiest claudia silva  charge aura attack use air jumping careful land close throw learn block counter colcovard drop edge may well give match ideally block attack charging aura let lose high aura attack bounce somersaulting swoop take almost every time match far easiest doppelganger battle takeshi fujioka  charge aura attack start match doppelganger leap almost every time nail high aura attack repeat pattern charging aura slicing doppelganger air jump three time usually doppelganger get low energy probably wo nt set fast fireball try block kicking sliding attack nail vulnerable careful  doppelganger low energy favorite tactic corner throwing range stand waiting strike  moment block knock aura attack  wait get strike patten repeat sometimes best tactic deal  menace simply block wait strike counter one risk getting thrown mean strategy still remarkably effective ie actually win dammit done carefully enough rob vincent  careful jumping doppelganger nt shy showing spiral cutter tornado slash time right aerial aura attack especially fireball help great deal watch jump sure knock air ideally special attack  nt underestimate effectiveness sliding attack purpose large blast force wave across screen also good get fireball trap going much better probably rd easiest doppelganger match three equally hard gregory darrell  usually strip away half energy knocking air high aura attack leap jumping kicking aerial aura attack usually take staying ground countering aerial strike get low energy time thing advisable spin standing special attack tidal wave norman burst super crush wait impale norman burst particular ideal counter bastard head butt blat vaike  usually get low energy countering high aura attack jump suitably injured take staying ground learn block anger beast attack hit throw right move careful aerial special attack low energy like block counter arscreik hammer one often get effective combination typically aerial attack followed mad hammer rolling madness use anger beast risk host game show host hair like guile galford wear
