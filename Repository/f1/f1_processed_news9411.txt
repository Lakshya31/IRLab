backtrack bit propose member network method address problem hatemail originating foreign network perhaps would best general people method cause unwanted network packet stop coming bulletin board need necessarily unwanted email though likely scenario problem network administrator generally hesitant provide protection system network avoid responsibility addressing crossnetwork problem pointing fact

protection propose new convention since thing traditionally named place discussed signed effect berne capital switzerland geneva city etc since operate  place  virtual actual nd since convention vastly virtual actual point even propose tentative name  virtual protection convention  network could sign thus provide member form crossnetwork protection network harassment could choose sign case joining system would know advance protection would afforded needed obviously network could sign thing first must exist tricky part phrasing would need general enough specific network functioning either technically politically irrelevant clear enough protection crossnetwork harassment still maintained pointed serious flaw network homogeneity evergrowing trend also pointed method network adminis trators use solve least part problem wording convention worked effect network coordinator interested providing protection harassment member system urged contact wwivnet suggestion addition convention better name vpc matter enough people work wording eventually good enough sysops user least form protection crossnetwork abuse end think laudable goal believe joining berne union good thing united state someday hopefully long see network application  member virtual protection convention  somesuch thus know advance whether sysops user protection crossnetwork abuse sysops brag member network signed vcp thus assuring user protection harassed across network problem nt really wide scale suspect common u think simply go unreported ignored even problem since currently real method

reported time mb mb hard drive acting strangely boot drive would boot fine one reset would nt another machine would seem forget hard drive partition work fine hour later bios information would get lost apparent reason   aha  though know problem power supply going bad knew motherboard cmos battery okay since bought new dx motherboard cpu mere month power supply case full size desktop last piece remaining hardware left entire machine  everything else upgraded throughout year went bought  refrigerator  larger full size bay size tower case new watt power supply carefully dutifully moved gut one machine hooked done around thought worked  came home week later find great case side swing open allowing easy access inside nonworking tape backup remember disabled tape backup software week nt reenabled everything else seemed work fine opened wife one town visiting relative el paso see oh tape backup data cable disconnected reconnected hooking necessity  keyboard video power connector  fired found tape backup worked fine cdrom stopped working  strange thank goodness never button case testing thing think fixed save lot time something else need working doubled checked software first always first step since easier checking risking breaking something else big ole hand rummaging around inside case everything looked great okay time go back case  thought found problem noticed bit card bit card slot bit card slot   meaning position motherboard closer power supply sometimes render bit card inoperable especially bit card bit  answer   call  cpu destined bit card case bit card never

return sheer luck notice screw one came rail case one came drive long replaced screw one came drive hooked back finally work final software tweaking buttoning set audio cable go cdrom sound card oh well pick one tomorrow use front panel miniplug jack plug stereo computer speaker week finally stable thing happen power machine start going bad knew beginning nt know bad power beginning fluctuate unacceptable high low would damage certain component machine point would become intermittent later date well intermittent problem worst thing try track going upgrading machine lot past year hard drive motherboards floppy keyboard ram dram simms etc  keep mind power supply need taken consideration well without stable power computer wig also take consideration wattage work motherboard faster cpu draw

load device driver tsrs absolutely need live reduced conventional memory use multiconfig setup running huge application game show  msdos memory management system consists three part first himemsys device driver himemsys provides access computer extended memory meg himemsys make physical extended memory accessible xms memory program designed take advantage xms short  extended memory

conventional memory k important program hma available system must least k extended memory meg computer computer meg total system memory usually able take advantage loading do hma second emmexe device

line doshigh umb configsys umb part necessary do able access upper memory provided emmexe high part nt really required perform important function free close k conventional memory moving do kernel hma created himemsys  use highly recommended note separate doshigh dosumb line want something msdos memmaker like combining doshigh umb bit tidy one le line do process bootup line similar following must

 msdos  version himemsys emmexe newest msdos  version older window  version older still msdos  version oldest even window  installed always use newest version himemsys emmexe since contain fix

following explains parameter common emmexe line ibbff parameter tell emmexe convert area reserved memory normally monochrome video adapter upper memory perfectly safe use monochrome gain k upper

convert first half system rom bios upper memory gain extra k upper memory unfortunately cause problem quite system example many system exhibit erratic floppy drive behavior plain old system lockup

ram buffer ddfff area ibm p computer use eefff range advanced bios computer epsons use range vga bios instead normal ccff range avoid memory conflict best bet would first examine reserved memory area space contain rom way see multiple parameter must used instead one big range would best range k em page frame using em memory support utility called msd microsoft diagnostics come window  msdos x microsoft product also utility pc magazine called umascan display nice map reserved memory area one trick msdos x user using emmexe parameter nohi prevent emmexe taking k reserved memory code k take away free conventional memory however device driver tsr requires couple k load resident upper memory trade well worth order fit share upper memory emmexe take k conventional memory k share driver fit upper memory configured emmexe maximum upper memory optimize loading order device driver tsrs hopefully fit upper memory easiest way msdos x run memmaker custom mode necessary change emmexe line back way configured maximum upper memory since memmaker put size value l parameter device driver tsr load line easily reorder load one largest size value first since require free upper memory initialize going resident usually memmaker reordering always best using msdos x optimizing loading order device driver tsrs involved trialanderror deal first check memory usage mem c command note device driver tsr loading upper memory move line load device driver tsr higher configsys autoexecbat reboot check mem c keep trying necessary hopefully get everything load upper memory remember device driver loaded himemsys emmexe configsys normal setup use certain device driver tsr must load another one work properly ca nt always optimize loading order example new smartdrive  included msdos  cache cdrom drive order cache cdrom drive smartdrive must loaded mscdexexe driver since mscdexexe must loaded first load upper memory smartdrive may able completely fit upper memory anymore depending else loaded upper
