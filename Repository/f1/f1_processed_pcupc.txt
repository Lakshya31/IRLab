cracking whenever valid password found given user pcupc skip user remainder crack save time verbose output active pcupc skip user echoed screen instead usual  using u format cracking whenever valid password found user pcupc move next user save time default format capability faster throughput compared second format reason simple examine following example format hypothetical situation word user
