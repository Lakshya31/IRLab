december first put bb run ibmpc meg hard disk hayes running wwiv v interpreted basic crawled along quite slowly whole lot feature bbs competing time run apple ii also running interpreted basic course rbbss like recall ever called one soon k limitation ibm interpreted basic became apparent pretty strange stuff memory allocation string storage pretty much reached cutoff point try typing line message result  memory  error know time go something better better thing turbo pascal  turbo  support directory file io within current directory also quite trouble getting comm routine working release turbo  put wwiv v soon got real interruptdriven comm routine thing started moving along go ucla forced take bb around december christmas vacation decided put bb back reason major revamping time around called wwiv v still turbo pascal  though around time december got around putting file section took quite bit work getting xmodem working go back reformat data file allow file description since never actually ibmtype bb clue file section work thing turned pretty randomly january finally released wwiv v ended going quite revision especially first week two released make thing even fun resume class ucla ended pretty much writing wwiv without running bb may guess caused unfortunate bug slip life sometime around june decided put ansi color call wwiv v involved reformatting user list store user color selection little fun thing decided put bb week move back ucla time summer session might think many people would end calling bb pretty much stated week managed get pretty good activity make week even fun half friend mine stephen davis call remotely take care experimental bb even managed make without crashing releasing turned pretty bad bug ymodem routine bb would read block data seek right place file instead first seeking reading came rather quickly around january put bb running around june started writing wwiv v naturally since summer job thing go fast also fact never written anything life c help eventually got hang thing finally dec put  bb testing real life among big promise great would said would support networking among system thought sounded like good idea clue would go implementing time relegated  nt hold breath  status secretly thinking might never get around surprisingly get around relatively soon time everyone already installed bb computer stuck format dreamed long time ago clue would work  number  indicating system ended trying design network around although quite optimal solution thing bored one day talking someone network decided start writing program send file computer planning pretty much sat typed developed networkexe program course actually networkexe program mostly working started thinking system would connect together originally started idea pretty much hierarchial localsystem list system call directly system local talking stephen davis decided pretty much gridlike amorphous structure however prevent structure applied without software change easily changed straight hierarchial structure would set hierarchy change one file send update well pretty much brings present time future expansion know one thing keep appearing multiline wwiv practical wwiv depends upon many external program chain fsed archiving program practically bb run external program without running multitasking operating system put simply pcdos designed multitasking mind  amazing  disappearing gfiles jeff garzik east bay ray release wwiv v brought many new feature zmodem batch downloads almost k memory saving tc overlay upload event much wwiv v also brought hideous bug v gfiles section disappeared new one could created might guessed created stir almost immediately amber wwivnet see wayne made small typographical error xinitc told bb look gfile data gfiles directory mistake gfiledat file go data gfiles problem easy fix first run bb copy gfiledat data directory gfiles directory whenever edit gfileedit g wfc screen copy gfiles directory registered

solution sometimes used conjunction lan user commercial multitasker desqview doubledos m window multi taskers allow use one program concurrently price program speed final solution bb multitask using routine bb multitasking using routine usually efficient solution cause least program slowdown also remove author dependence another company product drawback include author access resource large commercial lan method requires lot hardware involves computer node node pc generally accepted method large bbs lan however sometimes notoriously slow commercial multitasker method general choice hobbyistsysop allows multiple node single computer running program time slow individual program single processor handling load one program time processor slowdown really problem fast machine mhz
