phun novell brought u lord fouldecay th july ok novell network skool work would like supervisor account shit say novells security water tight frog arse friend read soon logging supervisor account briefly explain netware concept regard security experienced novell user supervisor skip bit stop complaining ok netware text refer mainly v advanced security feature intruder lockout cause problem run sequential password hacker namely x attempt password user locked specified period workstation lock kinda fuck remote dialups netware security consists mainly user group assigned  trustee right  given sub directory file right consist attribute  directory right control general access directory file subdirectory granted directory level right apply file subdirectory directory unless redefined file subdirectory level assigned directory right following effect supervisory grant right file subdirectory supervisory right override restriction placed subdirectory file inherited right mask user right directory grant user supervisory right directory file subdirectory supervisory right granted revoked directory granted revoked file subdirectory r read grant right open file directory read content run program w write grant right open modify file c create grant right create file subdirectory directory e erase grant right delete directory file subdirectory subdirectory file modify grant right change directory file attribute also grant right rename file directory sub directory right grant right modify content file f file scan grant right see directory file access control grant right modify directory file trustee assignment inherited right mask user also modify file trustee assignment inherited right mask user grant right except supervisory user including right granted command used grant modify directory trustee assignment filer grant remove revoke syscon view current effective right current directory use filer right whoami useful command slist display list server currently attached userlist display list user currently logged purpose brievity going go security concept require info read netware reference manual yes hahaha enough people want might write detailed explanation netware security use abuse etc kinda like netware bible want see something like drop line obtaining supervisor password  ok method work every novell network version small problem need get physical access file server wish gain supervisor access hard place lock file server process could take require file server make sure one else logging wo nt get caught sure elite enough wanting figure way one possibility make exact copy file server going work hang copy network target ca nt sheeez probably best thing target site multi server site select server least used easiest get supervisor likely use password file server server type   console format bootable do disk whatever disk type target server copy diskedexe file included archive onto bootable do disk bring server boot do disk do load run disked looking file net bindsys net bvalsys type r   prompt read sector type display sector keep viewing sector sequence ie etc alternating read display command see one two file keep track number current sector displaying possible although unlikely file sector assuming sector find file identify starting offset address first letter net bindsys file letter  n  using change command change e f character representation letter   use h whatever disked help internal command repeat step net bvalsys file exists sector net bindsys otherwise continue next change file attribute file eg let say e changed third character sample line e e etc etc directly line similar following f etc etc use change command change attribute     change byte file done sure enter   indicate change finished changing sector use write command write change drive eg w warning writing wrong sector really fuck thing make sure get right net bval different sector repeat step file finished type  q  exit do reboot file server net o look bindery nt find create new one go workstation logon supervisor new bindery supervisor password change sys system directory type showfile oet b make old bindery visible type del old rename oet b file net bold ie net bindsys net bvalsys new empty bindery net bindold net bvalold original bindery type bindrest restores bindery file renamed disked original status prior user restored nt know supervisor password restored system way currently logged supervisor type syscon either change supervisor password cause stir want remain unseen create user give security equivalence supervisor hit in list user syscon create user select security equivelance hit in select supervisor best account give supervisor right guest make sure assign password guest thats repeat file server desired want info novell shit know cool shit novell want ask something contacted zer city zer city decay whq  hst  sysop lord fouldecay co rokstardecay note take responsibility content file suggest try unless good understanding netware bos hit roof destroy file server bad luck suggest setting v server home trying first latz  decay production right reserved
