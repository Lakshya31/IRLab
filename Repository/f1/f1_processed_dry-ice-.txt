nt opportunity play due lack initiative go track dry ice  good luck though careful                floater hardyuwashingtonedu auston peddicoat date oct  gmt found following file thought interesting enough try anyone ever try somthing like would appreciate info ie work modification etc spelling mistake nt mine past many people experimented power generated conversion dry ice gaseous carbon dioxide common use seen dry icy ice bomb easily made using two liter plastic bottle hot water crushed dry ice make one one simply put cup half crushed dry ice bottle add hot water cap bottle throw bomb joke known blow metal trash fifteen foot air well bursting bottom make dry ice bomb best throw explodes due enormous force generxplosion bottle friend mine waited bit long throwing one jammed three finger badly got huge bruise left leg one plasic fragment propelled enough force puncture tennis shoe cut foot hell short careful thing one day may idea introduced friend plan control force expanding dry ice
