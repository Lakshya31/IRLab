dialdatadat third party program pgp vincrypt remember fed confiscate everything problem pitfall           getting tsr run system real hassle tsrs give memory problem youll definately trouble one us entire segment memory k manner operates may give program heebee jeebies ive tested telix v terminate v problem whatsoever ymmv two program problem sure gedit borland c compiler run fine tsr installed dont try pop also dont try deactivate tsr another program running exit do first limitation writing tsr program extremely simple time slow practical limit number dialup entry get pretty slow going page thats entry like shouldnt problem lower grade machine suffer delete function viewmodify dialups particularly slow delete entry near beginning data file finally cant account every situation insist something silly like adding dialups file transfer refuse take flack bug report appreciated use common sense closing    written c tsr support function confiscated  art c  herbert schildt based earlier program program mine called telenet hopefully many people saw program suggestion comment etc welcome youre proficient coding degree wise shut hell iiu special thanx dr delam maldoror greets pscream gp
