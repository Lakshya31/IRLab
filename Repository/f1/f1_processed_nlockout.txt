disabling ne  lockout chip  rev  sep  introduction       document detail simple modification perform nintendo entertainment system video game console order remove  lockout chip  protection system might want well think couple reason  unlicensed game ca nt played model ne  foreign game currently use clumsy adapter system example performing modification use pal game u console use u game pal console console document copyright  mark markk inamecom latest version available http wwwnetcomukcoukmarkkindexhtml explicitly permitted include unmodified document web site ftp site like procedure given work old design ne ie front loading model new design ne nt lockout chip anyway modification play pal game european hong kong uk pal console however ca nt play pal game u console play u game pal console game incompatible different display standard example high speed pin bot hang console time lord digger rock various game developed rare ltd however majority game work fine note know convert pal ne give hz display please contact possible enable ne game played ne correct speed modification similar easily done snes master system mega drivegenesis console suspect ne would need new ppu chip perform procedure console please let know whether work want update document applicable many console possible please tell pcb revision console eg nescpu serial number also lockout chip number eg   successfully carried procedure uk model ne pcb revision nescpu unlicensed game u european licensed game work fine unlicensed game tried action crystal mine firehawk super adventure quest procedure reported work u model ne revision nescpu interested operation lockout chip ne history general might like read david sheff excellent book  game  consult u patent  andor  indeed obtained information necessary carry modification one patent background      ne first released usa nintendo developed system preventing use unauthorised software much counterfeit software apparently produced famicom family computer game system nintendo wanted avoid happening ne another benefit nintendo least system legal third party development severely hindered nintendo licensee could buy lockout chip one fitted inside every game cartridge licensee apparently charged around u chip company managed get around lockout system produce unlicensed game example active enterprise codemasters camerica color dream tengen though tengen system ruled infringe nintendo copyright  ne  program program inside lockout chip macronix inc filed u patent  detail method getting around lockout however life ne nintendo periodically modified console meaning unlicensed game longer worked example  action   crystal mine  work u ne ne board revision nescpu unable play game disabling lockout chip solves problem nintendo also used lockout system provide  territorial protection  mean ca nt use uk european game u console example least four different type lockout chip used uk european hong kong u machine cartridge one type lockout chip incompatible console containing type lockout system work               brief description consult nintendo patent detailed information identical chip fitted console inside every game cartridge depending whether certain pin pin chip grounded v chip function either lock key inside console pin lockout chip v lock inside game cartridge pin v key switch ne cpu ppu held reset state two lockout chip talk since chip identical saying exactly thing exactly time chip compare output counterpart match lock chip release reset state console game start two chip still talk output two chip ever differ lock chip cause console repeatedly reset key chip inside game cartridge may use chip select line cartridge rom chip disable though disabling rom probably never done lockout chip fact bit microprocessor internal rom ram program rom called  ne  modification work              depends changing lock device think actually key device configured type ie key quote nintendo patent  unstable state take place operation performed  mean two chip nothing console reset key device disable cartridge rom chip carry modification need disconnect pin lockout chip connect pin ground v instead something wrong entire pin break nt worry happened console still work fine may absolutely necessary connect pin v leaving unconnected may okay thinking might done defeat protection system came three answer first simplest presented second complicated work different manner tried method ca nt say whether actually work basically involves connecting output chip chip input chip would talk since input always output chip think counterpart right type reset machine third method involves disconnecting mhz clock lockout chip console line lead lockout chip clock pin cartridge may well work clock device halted thus able anything performing modification              need following  crosshead screwdriver suitable opening ne case removing screw inside  sharp small knife pair scissors similar cut ic pin twosided implement eg scissors preferable knife  soldering iron solder optionally desoldering braid  short length thin insulated wire end stripped insulation cm enough removing screw make sure remember type go hole stepbystep instruction remove six screw base ne lift upper part case remove seven screw attach upper metal shielding pcb remove shielding remove two screw around modulator one left rf jack front av jack remove six screw attach cartridge tray pcb case black plastic connector note  middle  pair different others longer silver colour gently lift pcb cartridge tray lower shielding case remove lead controller port powerreset switch pcb remove lower metal shielding slide cartridge tray forward lifting away pcb connector leave connector attached pcb turn pcb component side black cartridge connector towards note pcb revision printed white ink near centre pcb example  nescpu  white sticker pcb tell type console example uk model say  palmtl  mtl short mattel american console say  ntsc  hong kong console say  palasi  asi probably short asia let know different find lockout chip  u cic  printed pcb u number relevant  cic  lockout chip console following text printed  nintendo uk model console known number american european hong kong chip pin locate pin lockout chip row nearest fourth left need cut pin bend away pcb may need bend couple capacitor pcb away lockout chip order get something go wrong entire pin break nt worry see  modification work  section may help desolder pin first use desoldering braid try cut close possible pcb decent length left attached chip neater way would desolder entire chip bend pin resolder chip leaving pin sticking however quite difficult nt special ic desoldering tool step optional thing seem work fine pin left unconnected connect ground like solder length wire pin ground suitable place connect pin lockout chip since grounded pin row furthest away second left may want test ne fitting back together put pcb back case connect power controller connector slide cartridge tray position making sure lip pcb put game cartridge switch hopefully everything work check whether lockout chip really bypassed switch cartridge inserted blank screen flashing effect reassemble console enjoy new universal ne
