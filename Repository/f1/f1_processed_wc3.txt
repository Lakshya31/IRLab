game release  fast processor need                         sx probably slowest processor run game playable pace vga mode former requirement two month ago   kind video card need

anything optimal  need cdrom drive fast                       since wing commander iii cdrom release floppy version planned either cdrom release yes cdrom drive required suggested even try game single

commander iii take advantage math coprocessor  game would run sx sx system still represent significant market share origin target audience option would write two separate version game one sx system dx system unfortunately would add much time development cycle  kind frame rate expect  estimate course still preliminary may change time game complete however chart officially released origin detailing fast fps frame per second wc run system vga svga svga local bus    pentium pentium number average space combat fighter around capital ship game run  fps slower cinematics problem run acceptably xx sx easily hit  fps mark faster system reason performance mainly dependent system memory rather processing power wing requires meg ram also slow system able run cinematics effectively  big term disk space wing commander iii  game currently slated ship four cd probably somewhere  gigabyte ten meg need installed hard drive  probably much le  wing commander iii support vga svga mode resolution  yes wc made first foremost vga game run standard xx resolution xx svga mode optional feature need pentium higher run user option running gameplay andor cinematic sequence either xx xx depending best suited

wing commander iii use bitmap polygonbased graphic difference  wc like origin flight sim game since strike commander use texturemapped polygon instead plain bitmap first two wing commander game nt familiar advantage polygonbased graphic engine allow explain  first two wing commander game use bitmap represent ship object space ship actually centered single point space boundary defined invisible box surrounding point note boundary defined box rather shape ship see screen  gun shot come really close enemy nt actually hit image screen explode space next still damage  hit invisible box surrounding ship box fly around space try shoot image spaceship placed change depending angle looking box thus ship first two wc game actually flying box picture oneman fighter slapped still following good polygonbased engine  kind wc us  much different rather boundary defined invisible box object made geometric shape  cylinder might represent body plane two triangle could represent wing forth boundarydefining shape visible player unlike flying box wc since ship made plain polygon look bit ugly take look flight simulator four five year ago various technique used improve appearance wc us  texture mapping  mean texture texture picture anything sheet glass certain color metal picture pilot cockpit placed bare polygon give attractive appearance final result ship still look really cool much clearly  defined  many advantage gunfire hit space next opponent still damage  check section  example made possible use polygonbased flight engine wing  gameplay issue  way wc scarcely resembles predecessor svga graphic make everything like four time sharp combat move faster pace aspect capital ship planetside combat entirely new experience altogether everything come together way origin plan wc play better previous osi sim date read   flight model wc previous wc game  yes two flight model available wc user choose use traditional wc flight model used wc wc new flight model similar one used xwing ship roll whenever yaw turn left right  capital ship capital ship combat like  perhaps one biggest improvement previous wc game day capital ship little big uglylooking sluggish fighter shot cloud flak waiting fire gun blast kingdom come gone wc capital ship huge  several screen long fact  fly one really struck sense awe rather sense boredom detail tremendous able make thing like capital ship flight deck confederate kilrathi insignia painted side dozen little window dotting hull really neat thing nt decoration either  actually fly around inside ship hangar made possible wonderful polygon technology talked section  theoretically game engine allow fly airlock side ship negotiate fighter maze twisting turning passageway  particular example would probably little use actual gameplay give feel exactly game capable primary constraint much time artist draw everything game release actual combat capships much involved well destroying carrier earlier wc game often involved little strafing run unloading gun time broke shield armor case ship wc sitting got torpedo lock firing either way fairly monotonous generally challenging wc longer case know flak bullet capital ship kept shooting trying get torpedo lock target gun turret blow need stop ship reaching jump point shoot couple missile engine disable destroying flight deck vital step dispatching capital ship well  planetside mission like  four ground mission wing vital plot planetside combat designed playability rather realism mind nt whole lot realworld physic worry ship  repulsors  negate effect gravity also
