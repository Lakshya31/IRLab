think better idea call day whenever user would normally use account arouse sysadmin suspicion abnormal calling time others think better call nobody around tough one real answer sysadmin keep log read definetly think strange secretary call probably look closer find even stranger secretary grabbed password file proceeded set himherself root shell hand call time user would normally call real owner account may well log see name already even worse denied access account already use end opinion remember make decision stick remember time zone change start         probably hardest period hacking first starting finding penetrating first system major step approached many way common way find system hack university university commonly hundred user many nt computer literate make hacking relatively
