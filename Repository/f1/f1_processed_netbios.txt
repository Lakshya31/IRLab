understanding netbios neonsurge released rhino team preface begin reading paper understand paper written novice concept netbios also contains information veteran might find educational prefacing get email like  start paper basic  simple written people may coming enviroment use netbios would need start basic thanks neonsurge rhino team whats netbios netbios network basic inputoutput system originally developed ibm sytek application programming interface api client software access lan resource since creation netbios become basis many networking application strictest sense netbios interface specification acessing networking service netbios layer software developed link network operating system specific hardware originally designed network controller ibm network lan netbios extended allow program written using netbios interface operate ibm token ring architecture netbios since adopted industry standard common refer netbioscompatible lan offer network application set

netbios actually manipulate data netbios specification defines interface network protocol used reach service protocol historically paired network protocol called netbeui network extended user interface association interface protocol sometimes caused confusion two different network protocol always provide least one method locating connecting particular service network usually accomplished converting node service name network address name resolution netbios service name must resolved ip address connection established tcpip netbios implementation tcpip accomplish name address resolution
