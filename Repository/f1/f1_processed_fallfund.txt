fallout fundamental fallout consists dust particle coated radioactive byproduct atomic explosion occurs nuclear atomic blast ground rather airburst airburst meaning fireball far enough earth surface ground material uptake high temperature portion mushroom cloud air burst bomb product condensate small particle aloft long time mostly nonradioactive time come typically month year fission process give hundred different radioactive element isotope also certian portion fission mass fission fussion portion nuclear bomb clean give helium atomic bomb trigger fission start nuclear bomb fussion portion bomb leaf radioactive byproduct byproduct classified characteristic one characteristic halflife halflife length time take element give onehalf total radioactivity would also length time

something like food inside become radioactive alpha beta gamma radiation make anything become radioactive alpha radiation helium nucleus protrons neutron like plutonium shielded one layer cellophane
