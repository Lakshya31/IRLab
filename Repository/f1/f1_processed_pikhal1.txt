helium impossible halflives minus second hence primordial soup way get something heavier helium collision couple relatively scarcer heavy nucleus three body collision would extremely rare event statistically got another forbidden barrier mass since beryllium half life minus second everything wait sun burn could process enough helium heavy atom achieve nuclear chemistry allowed early history universe way two nearly insurmountable barrier encountered getting cg g simple act methylating aromatic hydroxyl group provided mixture could resolved component pretty intricate maneuver product
