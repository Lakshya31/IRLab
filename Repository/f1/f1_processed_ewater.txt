purifying water guarantee safety water reduce risk involved boiling water one safest method water purification boiled least minute insure bacteria killed boiling remove pollution boiling process make water taste flat since air driven add back oxygen improve taste pour water several time one container another another method pour water closed container vigorously shake small piece wood pinch salt
