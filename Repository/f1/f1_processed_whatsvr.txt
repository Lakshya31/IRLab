available simplest method called flat shading simply fill entire area color next step provides variation color across single surface beyond possibility smooth shading across surface boundary adding highlight reflection etc effective short cut visual rendering use  texture   image  map picture mapped onto object virtual world instead calculating lighting shading object renderer determines part texture map visible visible point object resulting image appears significantly detail otherwise possible vr system special billboard object always face towards user mapping series different image onto

program control hardware device support  storage method number different way world information may stored single file collection file database multiple file method one common approach vr development package object one file geometry script etc overall world file cause file loaded system also include configuration file defines hardware interface connection sometimes entire database loaded program startup system read currently needed file real database system help tremendously latter approach object oriented database would great fit vr system aware project currently using one data file often stored ascii human readable text file however many system replaced binary computer file system world information compiled directly application  object object virtual world geometry hierarchy script attribute capability object tremendous impact structure design system order retain flexibility list named attributevalues pair often used thus attribute added system without requiring change object data structure attribute list would addressable name ie cubemass mass cube object may scalar vector expression value may addressable within script object might accessible script object  positionorientable object positionable orientable location orientation space object attribute modified applying translation rotation operation operation often implemented using method vector matrix algebra  hierarchy object may part object part hierarchy parent sibling child object object would inherit transformation applied parent object pas sibling child hierarchy used create jointed figure robot animal also used model thing like sun êplanets moon solar system  bounding volume additionally object include bounding volume simplest bounding volume bounding sphere specified center radius another simple alternative bounding cube data used rapid object culling rendering trigger analysis object whose bounding volume completely outside viewing area need transformed considered rendering collision detection bounding sphere rapid could used alone method culling object rigorous collision detection algorithm applied  object geometry modeling object shape geometry large diverse field approach seek carefully model exact geometry real world object method seek create simplified representation vr system sacrifice detail exactness simplicity sake rendering speed simplest object single dimensional point next come two dimensional vector many cad system create exchange data view information useful vr system except display surface within virtual world program reconstruct model object given number view  polylines polypoints simplest object known polypoints polylines polypoint simply collection point space polyline set vector form continuous line  polygon common form object used vr system based flat polygon polygon planar closed multisided figure maybe convex concave system require convex polygon use polygon often give object faceted look offset advanced rendering technique use smooth shading texture mapping system use simple triangle quadrilateral instead general polygon simplify rendering process surface known shape however also increase number surface need rendered  vertex join set polygon format vertex join set polygon format useful form polygonal object object vjs common pool point referenced polygon object transforming shared point reduces calculation needed render object point edge cube processed rather three edgepolygons reference plg format used rend example vertex join set byu format used ancient moviebyu program geometry format support precomputed polygon vertex normal polygon vertex allowed color attribute different renderers may use ignore possibly advanced surface characteristic precomputed polygon normal helpful backface polygon removal vertex may also texture coordinate assigned support texture image mapping technique  primitive system provide primitive object cube cone sphere sometimes object slightly deformed modeling package provide interesting object  solid modeling boolean operation solid modeling aka computer solid geometry csg one form geometric modeling us primitive object extends concept allowing various addition subtraction boolean operation primitive useful modeling object concerned physical calculation center mass etc however method incur significant calculation useful vr application possible convert csg model polygon various complexity polygonal model could made single high resolution metaobject csg type  curve patch another advanced form geometric modeling use curve curved surface aka patch effective representing complex shape like curved surface automobile ship beer bottle however significant calculation involved determining surface location pixel thus curve based modeling used directly vr system possible however design object using curve compute polygonal representation curved patch various complexity polygonal model could made single high resolution metaobject  dynamic geometry aka morphing sometimes desirable object change shape shape might simply deformed bouncing ball squashstretch used classical animation toon might actually undergo metamorphosis completely different geometry latter effect commonly known morphing extensively used film commercial television show morphing done image domain morph geometry domain morph latter applicable vr system simplest method morph precompute various geometry step needed system significant processing power handle real time object morphing  swept object surface revolution common method creating object known sweeping surface revolution method use outline template curve backbone template swept along backbone creating object surface rotated single axis create surface revolution method may used create either curve surface polygonal object vr application sweeping would likely performed object modeling creation phase resulting polygonal object stored real time use  texture map billboard object mentioned section rendering
