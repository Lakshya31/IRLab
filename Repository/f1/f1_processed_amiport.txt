following excerpt article scheduled appear february issue amazing computing please refer article information io board well ordering information jl happy holiday  december port amiga io expansion board jeff lavin copyright puzzle factory many amiga community built brad fowles excellent  lucas  accelerator board introduced idea  public domain hardware  article present another public domain hardware project amiga enable add two parallel port two serial port amiga furthermore easily inexpensively upgrade four parallel port andor four serial port time hardware consists small printed circuit board pin cable dip jumper plug socket occupied cia b small pcb contains serial interface cia b physically moved onto io expansion board hardware support standard baud rate  baud plus midi  baud also support full hardware handshaking four unit may open one time although cpu may able keep four unit running baud raison detre  hardware hacker long standing number small computer sort hardware attached extra port eprom prog rammer longed amiga since amiga us pair actually io figured would piece cake add xx family peripheral chip running problem obvious chip select decoding could never figure addressed one day friend came able figure io chip  automatically  selected certain address generated logic hidden pal final piece puzzle place wasted time prototype amiga two week work  hardware hack possible two thing designer amiga u address space cia live incompletely decoded mean cia register echoed repeatedly large range location software supposed address cia register completely specified much smaller range two fact make possible u take chip select one cia divide four part address upper part routed cia normally  steal  address remainder space use  hard  part address decoding bus timing done u get away nothing complicated additional address decoder split address space unfortunately hack possible reason possible earlier amigas address decoding complete  extra  incompletely decoded address  steal  via acia register still echoed pretty wide address range specified address reason commodore specified address cia ensure software compatibility would much like see enough people build board create installed software base programmer please use address writing neat multiline bb program multiuser application well process control program robotics demo etc software  course hardware next useless without software drive section describes software available io expansion board serial driver         almost program written amiga use serial port notable exception midi software access indirectly via standard software module called  serialdevice  result existing software work fine io board given suitable driver supply one named  newserdevice  simply copy  devs  directory youre business program permit change device name serialdevice newserdevice well unit number indicating port used may use supplied iopatch utility described see  support program  worth noting program relating io board supply complete assembly language source code driver encounter problem else fails possible fix parallel driver          four parallel port io expansion board controlled eightbitdevice known difference device v paralleldevice application experience problem communicating eightbitdevice device level full assembly language source code driver supplied io expansion board doslevel support          doslevel support  refers ability get send data via serial parallel port standard amigados command type list program serial parallel io via amigados rather directly via execlevel  newserdevice   eightbitdevice  although sort capability frequently used useful time time perfect world doslevel support would mean nothing appropriate mountlist entry specifying driver name  newserdevice   eightbitdevice  unit number choosing corresponding do name  ser   par  unfortunately commodore supplied version porthandler auxhandler workbench v doesnt permit rather hardcoded use either  serialdevice   paralleldevice  printerdevice suffers similar limitation time writing nt solution using iopatch however expect replacement handler ready time read addition handler workbench v capability use device unit whole problem nonexistent v support program         several program available use io expansion board serprefs function much serial section preference allows set save parameter four unit newserdevice saved  serialpreferences  many program allow specify device name unit number using alternate device driver problem application insist using particular device written nice little hack called iopatch program setfunction exec opendevice call user put program startupsequence otherwise invokes run application program patch make small window appear whenever opendevice called choice unit  unit select internal serial parallel port unit  select one newserdevice eightbitdevice unit please note name driver selected length name original device done facilitate filezapping last resort course software may written newserdevice eightbitdevice initially suite simple test program check io expansion board hardware save hour hardware debugging time chip selects well read write signal generated chip one program simulates simple characteroriented terminal program checking acia nice little program drive realtime clockcalendar also available clock hardware based oki msm capable generating interrupt hz per second per minute hourly software take advantage feature left exercize student credit  would like thank dan babcock many hour put writing debugging serial device driver surely one difficult part project paul coward digisoft provided u parallel device driver small achievement either jim cooper software distillery made many helpful suggestion concerning software issue especially do compatibility helped u get speed bill seymour provided invaluable help layout preproduction pcbs also provided design help finally task made easier help encouragment doug sears grace lavin conclusion  think pretty neat little hack also feel simple enough nt come someone else would provides muchneeded additional io amiga rockbottom price enough software becomes available warrant try set sort software clearing house use board keep eye bix bb symposium news meanwhile hope enjoy using board nt let blue smoke  need get touch possibility bix jblavin usenet jlavin cieuoregonedu
