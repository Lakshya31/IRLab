leo ryan killed jonestown went investigate people temple leo ryan coauthor hughesryan amendment obliged cia give congress prior notification covert operation something cia particularly crazy one interesting aspect jonestown concern body number people found initially news report described people temple encampment jonestown people reference american passport belonged people went jonestown massacre number began get kicked around suddenly dropped opinion many elite guard surrounded jim jones although people temple overwhelmingly black jones top lieutenant almost white exclusively almost opinion many studied jonestown situation critically people temple leadership allwhite leadership predominantly black organization passport immediately dropped view news massacre first hit american medium would encourage people sceptical thing saying go back newspaper account time people temple massacre happened november th saturday night four five day american newspaper new york time newspaper record major daily saying authority guiana could account body widespread speculation happened body initially description passport passage jonestown dropped four five day medium engaging speculation people four five day military commander jonestown testified ordered stop identifying body jonestown four five day medium suddenly accepted official version figured missing body really whole time nt noticed know sound funny actual official explanation four five day turning body said  oh body couldnt find first along didnt notice  actual official explanation course problem people nt pay much attention public news event country roughly three percent american people read newspaper american people read book american list television primary information source interestingly enough american people read average one book per person per lifetime average absurd true kind depressing mean got somebody like read hundred book average awful lot dumbkopfs nt read average one book per person per lifetime united state good see television image get image reading permit simultaneous integration concept think sad thing turned away printed word one thing try broadcast perhaps forge effective synthesis electronic medium printed word suffice say version jonestown gone history namely body mention disappeared first along  nt notice  go back look picture people temple massacre site damn bloodywell see nt body quite evident case people speculated definitive answer people speculated going lot people run away massacre site hunted killed brought back site never know sure cinch body hidden first four five day interestingly enough reported death squad associated people temple people enemy people temple would disposed people temple death squad put together survived massacre also noted number people temple dissident disaffected member died strange circumstance automobile accident etc prior move guiana noted although always official disclaimer people temple death squad existed interesting piece information perhaps analysis premature first person people temple death list first individual disposed people temple mayor george mosconi san francisco shot death nine day people temple massacre george mosconi campaign san francisco liberally aided people temple member jim jones named george mosconi head san francisco housing authority noted harvey milk also campaign liberally assisted people temple harvey milk also disposed obviously dan white many feel may programmed assassin personally subscribe theory talk dan white like question answer session despite official denial existence people temple death squad first individual people temple hit list shot dead nine day massacre number two people temple hit list woman named jeannie mill along husband al mill wrote book former people temple aide wrote book called six year god fiercely critical people temple jim jones placed name right behind george mosconi people temple hit list summer nine ten month jonestown

drugged andor perhaps silenced weapon utilized whatever case may murder jean al mill daughter believe name daphne sure case mill family assassination remains unsolved day shot gristle berkeley killing never solved number two people temple hit list suffice say although official disclaimer issued hit squad existed think would difficult time convincing george mosconi jean al mill circumstance unfortunately opportunity try mention background concerning people temple bear mind u national security establishment decides move given significant direction move direction scratch number different

select committee assassination conducting badly compromised investigation assassination john kennedy martin luther king investigation said badly compromised despite even badly compromised

louis based organized crime figure literally blown bit car bomb shortly house select committee concluded investigation well mark lane way grace stevens grace walden would present people temple massacre would eliminated course massacre fortunately go mark lane serving james earl ray defense counsel got think mark lane really interested justice client james earl ray would undertaking get grace walden grace stevens testify either congress court law testimony could used exonerate client rather going jonestown would exterminated already known shall say creative community possibility

necessary biological function see people beginning slump chair make exit strategic visit wherever back think going allow people make strategic visit still miss lecture time break  alrighty well suffice say time martin luther king mainstream element black civil right movement matter public record investigation destabilization intelligence service militant element black civil right movement black power movement also destabilized happened black panther example largely matter public record nation islam popularly known black muslim also infiltrationsdestabilization period time noted one main strategic vehicle used fbi cointelpro program infiltrate organization plant agent promote active hostility among various organization hopefully mortal activity hostility would mortal result fellow become quite well known connection quanza sp holiday example guy named ron karenga sp southern california according many source actively involved fbi agent involved stimulating hostility organization called u united slave black panther los angeles since become something guiding light black community number source never impeached including former fbi informant involved cointelpro identified ron karenga one main operative cointelpro southern california black muslim matter public record infiltration period time element involved infiltrating destabilizing black muslim nation islam involved aspect cointelpro including activity directed martin luther king division five fbi internal security division almost like separate agency put pressure organization called bossi infiltrate nation islam malcolm x breakaway organization called organization afroamerican unity going talk organization minute institution utilized called bossi new york city organized crime anti

aide bossi fellow named john caulfield two main operative richard nixon dirty trick operation political opponent john caulfield anthony ulazowitz actively involved infiltrating nation islam organization afroamerican unity behalf division five fbi incidentally john caulfield name surface connection warren commission document recruited warren commission look activity dre new york area dre directorio revolutionario estudiantil student revolutionary directorate one anticastro organization placed umbrella group crc umbrella organization overseeing anticastro cuban activity behalf cia worth noting bossi placed number agent successful infiltrating nation islam organization afroamerican unity one famous picture malcolm x assassination picture fallen fact appeared life magazine fallen malcolm x artificial resuscitation administered one bodyguard fellow named gene robert brother gene fact brother gene undercover agent bossi worth noting activity engaged time administering artificial resuscitation contraindicated pun intended someone suffering chest wound put air bubble blood stream reach heart cause cardiac arrest death administer artificial resuscitation cpr someone chest wound malcolm x massive chest wound would died anyway possibility surviving brother gene might well cut short activity supposedly engaging save malcolm x life also worth noting picture also taken right assassination curious bulge brother gene pocket obvious bullet hole jacket unclear got bullet hole jacket supposedly one malcolm bodyguard good job protecting malcolm x mentioned dr king assassinated year time switched altered say political activity  simply  civilrights activist antivietnam war activist well dr king correctly perceived growing cost economically politically vietnam war detracting effort nation could put redressing past grievance afroamericans saw vietnam war major impediment civil right colored people country people color also representing extension racial oppression kind racial oppression directed black others country representing extension racist ethic activity united state visavis people color country similar way kind activity malcolm x begun engaging prior assassination malcolm x top spokesperson trusted lieutenant elijah muhammed head nation islam popularly known black muslim however parted sharply elijah muhammed ultimately broke completely nation islam number different thing one thing nation islam historically political cooperation black people white people fact one main tenet nation islam black people engage political activity conjunction white people malcolm x took tour africa particularly impressed visit south africa noted close successful cooperation black white south africa apartheid regime among thing lead sharp revision political outlook among major thing malcolm broke elijah muhammed decision fact blackwhite political cooperation viable fact necessary ultimately liberation people color ultimately white people achieved united state elsewhere ran directly counter teaching nation islam even advocated abstinence political activity conventional sort black people nothing involvement white people also worth noting malcolm x broken elijah muhammed elijah muhammed personal ethical behavior elijah muhammed advocated strict celibacy strict moral behavior shall say people organization yet impregnated number secretary bore child wedlock fined otherwise censored organization alleged immoral behavior mentioning father child actually elijah muhammed appalled malcolm x also took great issue one main source break malcolm x elijah muhammed something also reflects infiltration nation islam use fbi vehicle agitation provocation developed elijah muhammed nation islam receiving large amount money none hl hunt rightwing texas oil billionaire covered juda factor karl evanzz discussed beginning lecture evening hl hunt one main financier far right country family name crop number different context connection assassination president kennedy little interesting find hl hunt avowed racist funding nation islam would appear speculative would appear main motivation hl hunt funding nation islam leaving aside possibility funding may supported division five fbi infiltration subversion organization hl hunt vocal viewpoint africanamericans fact cease africanamericans go back africa viewpoint also promulgated nation islam noted aryan nation element today found common cause lewis farakhan obstensible successor malcolm x actually believe successor elijah muhammed going talk farakhan later robert mile michigan ku klux klansman sentenced prison firebombing school bus order oppose forced busing state michigan tom metzger director white aryan resistance former klan leader worked actively lewis farakhan recent year historical parallel think functioning nation islam wing zionist movement well known well recognized history prior hitler socalled final solution jewish question ie extermination european jewry might term notsofinal solution  jewish problem  nazi began actively liquidating jewish population europe actively promoted jewish emigration palestine found common cause significant element zionist movement time rate actively collaborated ahmtb sp s intelligence service charge  jewish matter  head ahmtb adolph eichmann zionist movement seeking promote jewish emigration palestine build jewish population palestine nazi token looking make europe judenrhein sp jew free period time actually collaborated actively fact head one point hagana sp palestinian selfdefense organization precursor mossad fellow named fivel polkes polishborn jew actually serving agent s intelligence service order promote jewish emigration palestine also branch zionist movement explicitly fascist zionist like political movement mean monolithic addition liberal element zionist movement branch zionist movement explicitly avowedly fascist movement called betar betarim actually pitched battle street tel aviv rank betar socialistzionists best known graduate betarim movement menachem begin later went become course prime minister israel leader betarim fellow named vladimir yabotinski sp described menachem begin  screeching like old door  yabotinski article italian zionist publication le deias unistica sp made clear collaboration betarim mussolini active collaboration merely marriage convenience betarim ideologically supported fascism agreed mussolini betarim also received military training mussolini naval cadet school think element nation islam farukhan organization today could compared reactionary element zionist movement least period time found common cause ultimately advocated extermination world jewry worked time together order promote jewish emigration palestine token even though aryan nation portray black people cannibal black skirt bone nose cooking missionary pot explicit viewpoint black genetically inferior white yet pattern cooperation elijah muhammeds organization people like george lincoln rockwell fuhrer american nazi party enthusiastic supporter elijah muhammed nation islam hl hunt also avowed racist sought return black africa worth noting george lincoln rockwell name phone number arlington virginia address address book selfproclaimed marxist lee harvey oswald time arrest texas theater dallas texas ultimately course george lincoln rockwell well fellow named burrow daniel burrow another american nazi name address phone number oswald address book burrow supposedly committed suicide george lincoln rockwell assassinated supposedly rival nazi leader eventually convicted crime worth noting assassinated jim garrison investigation gaining steam new orleans daniel burrow one american nazi whose name address oswald address book supposedly committed suicide home ku klux klansman roy frankhauser sp later went work contract agent cia worth noting though frankhauser put alleged suicide daniel burrow  bad case suicide three bullet  still thats said though three bullet suicide bad case suicide almost bad danny casalero period time indication addition used vehicle infiltration element racist fascist movement country found common cause nation islam basically sought make america white country nation islam proved usual tool least certain extent view promoting end worth noting matter public record infiltration nation islam reached high successful level treasurer nation islam fellow named john ali like muhammed ali established freedomofinformation act document information john ali highly placed informant fbi following discreditation one elijah muhammed son result drug conviction john ali period time became powerful member nation islam incidentally work john ali fbi first revealed journalist louis lomax done lot work assassination martin

nation islam moral conduct elijah muhammed addition breaking nation islam prohibition blackwhite political cooperation malcolm x perhaps notably drawn fire reactionary force country intelligence service particular actively forming political alliance black people color part world specifically malcolm x took tour africa well received black african leader working petition leader african nation united state south africa condemned racist policy united nation would course tremendous blow international prestige united state particularly eye third world country matter public record declassified document source great consternation state department central intelligence agency richard helm director cia time concerned activity malcolm x instructed cia everything could  monitor  activity malcolm

malcolm x going assassinated malcolm x tour egypt narrowly escaped death poisoned number white european american suit never established seen following malcolm x around whenever would stop restaurant next table almost died poisoning egypt somehow got something food narrowly escaped death later wanted visit france turned away french authority orli sp airport also strange malcolm x problem getting
