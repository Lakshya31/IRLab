beta little prototype vector editor working present text file parser display program eventually become menu driven fully graphical vector editor actually late release thing programmed like five month ago lost interest working newer graphical version total reprogramming one version come collection object file take look help create light source shaded polygon object format simple anybody able wanting make demo object never mean chance sytax editor vedb filenameext using extension v case decide change format would nt want object file getting mixed different version made object ved v beta file format exactly rename file  filenamev   filenamev  version load v extension without problem like keep thing little organized vector object display program vedbexe menu driven allows simple thing object rotate object x axis axis z axis three axis change position light source also increase decrease distance object center world  default distance design large object good idea increase distance

first explain little theory work vector object simply bunch point placed specific coordinate imaginary graph point joined together forming corner polygon polygon together create object remember cartesian graph math teacher yacked high school well way idea except one dimension vertical horizontal dimension depth point specified three number form x z x horizontal dimension left right center x grows increasingly negative move left grows increasingly positive go right see number line                              vertical dimension center grows increasingly negative move grows increasingly positive go see number line      v z depth dimension center surface monitor z grows increasingly negative go screen grows increasingly positive come screen towards face see number line   inside screen                 screen  air infront screen put together graph system look like screen left             right towards specify point simply state x z coordinate together like x z next thing understand polygon object construct polygon polygon multisided closed shape vector editor restriction polygon system must make sure polygon convex mean draw straight line part polyon cut two edge make concave polygon display properly viewed simple way identify polygon convex see vertex corner two edge meet point outward interior see diagram idea mean       convex polygon display correctly notice corner point outwards                   concave polygon display correctly      notice corner point outward      get around problem split polygon smaller polygon like       convex polygon joined together make concave one      display correctly notice corner      polygon point outward center able draw polygon must list vertex want connect together guess another restriction vertex must listed counterclockwise order particular polygon facing listed clockwise displayed polygon drawing code eliminates nonvisible surface aka backface removal backface culling suppose wanted polygon supposed visible side instead one would get around restricton polygon one visible side well define one side polygon counterclockwise order spin polygon around side visible define counterclockwise order mean define polygon twice visible side okay know enough able start creating object let introduce file format first pointer allowed file comment allowed line file start comment   character end carriage return press enter key essentially idea comment c program comment go end line must make sure nt comment required data need make object load correctly put either line important information number appear file except one comment character   used anyway must integer mean value  including zero number must separated character numerical digit negative sign use comma thats always taught separate item list word warning must add separation character last uncommented number line remember editor ignore everything comment line blank space throughout file would happen editor would read last number line stick first number next line end previous line make big mess crash editor negative number negative sign directly infront number eg    positive number symbol infront eg  center object coordinate  mean rotation performed using coordinate pivot point please keep mind creating object know offset object bit get cool looking whirling effect know allowed must appear file number vertex object b list vertex giving coordinate x z c number polygon object list polygon following format number vertex polygon ii list vertex making polygon counter clock wise order visible iii color polygon used ved v beta use later version choose color gradiant range multiple light source shading color use following list show light source shading color available ved v beta grey white dark grey red light pink deep red yellow light yellow tan blue light blue deep blue purple light purple deep purple green light green deep green brown tan dark brown thats thats need make object good thing comment everything ca nt stress enough listing vertex put comment end line number starting zero necessary ready start defining polygon defining polygon step line group polygon make major section object make  debugging  object easier following sample object make cube                 cut                  example object new ved vb tumblin body motion number vertex list vertex format x z   vertex back top left   vertex back top right   vertex back bottom right    vertex back bottom right  vertex front top left  vertex front top right  vertex front bottom right   vertex front bottom left number polygon object polygon object format polygon list vertex color polygon  top viewed front  bottom  left  right  back  front done end object                 cut                  note nt bother putting comma last relevant number   case since number read okay nt get carried away final tip creating cool object start drawing sketch want look like paper try draw nice neat large diagram graph paper label vertex starting zero surface ca nt see draw another diagram rotating object around vertex visible keep numbering consistent rather awkward way design object unless good visualizing thing three dimension head thankfully without problem  another tip defining polygon listing vertex making particular polygon polygon visible way drawn list counter clockwise order visible list clockwise order help eliminate redrawing diagram provided complex enough room draw point label also good idea label axis even jot major coordinate object make thing little easier visualize see vedrev information revision history ved some chat source code information stuff developed using dx mhz computer turbo c v tasm v xlib v alright get thing compiled running go turbo c ide assuming using borland c compiler load vedbprj project get far make sure using large memory model try alt ptions c ompiler c ode generation select large memory model next make sure correct directory setup system done copy turbo c c tc directory create directory called c tcxlib put xlib  file must make sure directory ide take account use alt ptions irectory key system set include directory c tcinclude c tcxlib library directory c tclib c tcxlib using borland c  compiler example might change tc bc rest hopefully make convenient compile maintain stuff make xlib example simply use include xliballh beginning c program nt worry oh way highly recommend xlib graphic library people starting library coding find useful file project file vedbcpp main program fixedlasm bit fixed point multiply divide function xlibllib xlib v large memory model library file file current directory ever one want compile ved v beta vedbcpp main program fixedlasm bit fixed point multiply divide function vedclrh include file contains palette data xlibllib xlib v library file link code hit f make watch program compile link able run compiler alt r un r un usually drop do test usually spit text debugging purpose nt nt want get started email mcl jupitersuncsdunbca get back soon possible  signed tumblin p nt bother emailing object file anybody emailed object ved v beta release anyway new graphical version ved v almost ready also created file convertor convert object new v format info release
