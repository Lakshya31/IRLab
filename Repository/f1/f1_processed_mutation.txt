mutation written hacker phreaker pirateer almostaverage joe mind purpose extend highly secure cryptographic system end user program program us modified national bureau standard de data encryption standard algorithm achieve purpose along normal electronic code book cipher also option creating blockchained cipher decided write program felt inadequate supply encryption utility let explain encryption utility public domain shareware copyrighted either employed insecure encryption algorithm key password length much short make cracking hard take central point software  pcsecure  example pcsecure employ nb de algorithm key length limited character de standard safe key length secure mention sure central point software put type backdoor program case someone made ciphertext needed deciphered via abnormal mean another shareware utility  private line  thing private cipher program make wo nt able read cat private line employ de however key length miserable character long think  could bust cipher matter week unlike previous program horde program follow footstep proud release highly secure commandlined low memory overhead portable cryptographic tool briefing     mutation possible key length character electronic code book mode character per key cipher block chainings key requirement mention known trapdoors written program de algorithm thats another story see trapdoor theory mutation used electronic code book mode default mode option specified cipher block chaining mode ecb electronic code book mode us one key key password want use encrypt thusly also decrypt file ecb us one password cbc cipher block chaining us two password encrypt file file wish encrypt really anything list telephone number friend name password various system technical note hid dead body etc really encrypt anything however would recommend time stay away encrypting exe com file small bug program add byte end file effect output ascii file may mess execom file hope fix bug upcoming version using ecb option            order invoke ecb option default mutation needed knowing whether wish encrypt decrypt file password key wish use incoming filename outgoing filename instance wish encrypt file called telefonedoc use  fatcuntwhorecumbelchinggutterslut  password suppose output encrypted text file called telefonedoc see make sure original text overwritten never seen done c fatcuntwhorecumbelchinggutterslut telephonedoc telephonedoc c ok nice file called telephonedoc look messed nt know better swear face neighbor cracksmoking child amount time elapses decide need telephone number file problem enter c fatcuntwhorecumbelchinggutterslut telephonedoc telephonedec c read telephonedec get phone number need noticed used different filename decrypting file reason case fucked key overwrote encrypted file incorrect decrypting key check telephonedec see fine rename telephonedoc something else copy bullshit file place erase see way one able match enciphered text deciphered text figure key see easy using cbc option           note cbc available version  mutatin coming version cipher block chaining enabled cipher block chaining option little bit different ecb option mention bit secure see technical spec note cbc requires enter two password key let say wish use cbc file called technotedoc use  everyonewantstobeabigshottheres   toomanychiefsandnotenoughindians  two password output cipheredtext file called technotedoc c cbc everyonewantstobeabigshottheres toomanychiefsandnotenoughindians technotedoc technotedoc c notice text overran current line splashed onto next problem mutation use whole command line incoming keysfilename etc  pretty long password nt worry wrapping sure leave enough room filename note name without extension ie ibmbios valid mutation ok nice enciphered text bet would like read later huh well remember key else screwed ok let decrypt c cbc everyonewantstobeabigshottheres toomanychiefsandnotenoughindians technotedoc technotedec c thats done problem huh verify technotedec came correctly sure overwriterenameetc encrypted ciphertextfile going technical specification note                 data encryption standard algorithm conceived ibm adopted national bureau standard nation encryption standard data encryption standard algorithm block cipher enciphers identical eightbyte plaintext block identical eightbyte ciphertext block technically transforms input block file string output bit fixed length output file encipheringdeciphering function every bit output block depends jointly every bit input block every bit password de algorithm also known electronic code book ecb certain file exhibit great regularity many identical eightbyte block example memorandum always begin normally ecb encipherment identical block plaintext yield identical block ciphertext using key repetition block may also visible example telephone number plain text aligned eightbyte de block recognized identical ciphertext doubtful whether phenomenon serious weakness date technique found us determine password obtain usable plain text alphabeticnumeric file however existence identical block concealed cryptographic system strengthened least intuitively amount information available cracker reduced cipher block chaining come handy using mutation cipher block chaining option possible use de manner identical eightbyte plaintext block virtually always yield different ciphertext block without altering security existing algorithm thusly encrypting file lot repetition ie indented source code spreadsheet listing please use cbc strengthen code however life every good evil cbc easily cryptanalyzed basis moderate amount ciphertext see enough enciphered short block cryptanalyst could recover key decipher individual short block analyze various cipher system teach use product cryptanalysis de algorithm                  ask  de crackable  well time standpoint yes say  thought one could read  let ask question reasonable assume opponent obtain required information decipher ciphertext iefinding written extracting head etc computational cost attack ie much manpower fast enough computing facility etc much time require opponent wait  year cracking text true someone able read ciphertext really nt think care  year anyhow hell let make worst case hypothetical situation hate first let assume made cbc cipher two key character per key second must assume reason pissed wrong people government namely people effectively modified cray ymp national security agency deem necessary devote computing resource cracking file third must assume dead else would used sodiumpenathol long time ago get key fourth government people plan job current administration leaf white house precondition met well chunkyshit creek without paddle probably  year deciphered de key tested rate one per microsecond key trial would require excess  year however critic quick point massive parallelism pipelining time recover key reduced value precalculated scenario properly combining precomputation machine constructed would recover key high probability one day estimate cost  precomputation time year even estimate accepted way de would normally used cipherblock chaining initial chaining value would negate advantage gained timememory tradeoff thusly questionable organization would risk investment million dollar two year precomputation circumstance really cipher safe trapdoor theory         critic de leery method analysis used ibm validate de method used national security agency classified u government therefore critic inferred one sure statement ibm nsa de claimed see national security agency advised designer certain design criterion considered agency sensitive ibm requested publish selection criterion critic suggested special property might incorporated design substitution permutation aka trap door would give cryptanalytic advantage knowledgeable party proof offered refute existence trap door even ibm national bureau standard national security agency reveal criterion would undoubtedly critic would suggest revealed bottom line nearly year scrutiny viable method cryptanalyzing de discovered published bell telephone laboratory lexar corporation examined property substitution permutation lexar corporation reported  peculiar  property substitution box date feasible cryptanalytic de found keep public happy senate committee intelligence conducted investigation matter following summarizes conclusion reached de adequate intended application ibm invented designed de nsa tamper design nsa certified de free known statisticalmathematical weakness nsa recommended federal reserve board use de electronic fund transfer application trapdoor really doubt would risk releasing trapdoor public intelligence community large decipher piss wall hacker file point view password length         past tendency among user cryptographic system use word name key today procedure unsafe fewer million word unabridged fewer million name largest telephone directory number potential key could tested minute powerful computer today even use eight randomly chosen ascii character unsafe de key introduced directly consist ascii character ieaz az punctuation altkey combination see mutation able use byte password user might example enter several word chosen randomly independently unabridged dictionary user may enter phrase song tv commercial essential choice made way key practically found opponent either guesswork enumerating plausible set key hint extra        note cipher block chaining cbc available version  mutatin release fix mutation ecb mode use key character length cbc mode use two key maximum character per key assuming using one letter filename example c cbc passwordone passwordtwo b would give input file b output file larger password use stronger ciphertext becomes character password much better character password however block chaining two character password even stronger one character password strongest ciphertext possible suggest using cipherblock chaining char password note could use character password key character password key character password key character password key realize number swapped around make sure long possible strongest text sometimes making long password much bother someone trying break idea making long key sentence book phrase obscure song tvradio commercial column old newspaper make short story make face ascii char  etc sure think thing write like maybe first screw may personal incase someone break also make sure properly dispose encrypted filename decrypted first copy file another safe copy another rename fucker erase sob would also nice program setup path encipher stuff harddrive nice men jacket come borrow computer nt let data easily conclusion      documentation lot longer intended fact nt written probably confused lot reader oh well able discern run thing previous text small example built program would like thank legion luciferphuck releasing product intercontinental distribution system really help program access wide dispersal network thanks lolphuck earlier mentioned portability code code c quite portable releasing code various reason first possibility someone able figure de code modified secondly plan release amiga mac
