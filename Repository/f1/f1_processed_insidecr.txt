theoretically case full hold removed actual amount added outstanding balance resulting possible increase open buy amount practice older system capable matching settlement authorization hold simply expired based time would take transaction clear newer system starting get sophisticated reasonable job matching authorization actual amount settlement still nt match estimated amount well varying
