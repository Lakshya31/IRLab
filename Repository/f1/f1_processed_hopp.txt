new fbi attempt secure communication copyright c full disclosure right reserved fbi spent many million dollar attempting obtain secure communication various voice encryption method limited success gao report march  fbi voice privacy cost status future direction  provides much insight difficulty fbi establishing secure communication system fbi original estimate establishing digial voice protection system  million march th report indicates  b ecause fbi estimated saving cited table preliminary supported formal field survey documentation continue believe  million latest  million estimate nationwide voice privacy program appear unrealistic  big part major cost overrun lack technological review getting  feburary report explains technological impact range loss dvp system one factor increased fbi cost estimate  million  million report say fbi recognized research communication range dvp technology le range old unsecure system consider impact reduction fbi say statement totally error recognize range loss consider impact  followup discussion key fbi official knowledgable voice privacy cost estimate process told u fbi consider range loss  million estimate emphasized engineering consultant firm developed estimate part comparison analog versus digital voice privacy technology according official range loss serious considered fbi prepared  million estimate fbi say methodology developing  million estimate included doubled number repeater compensate dvp range loss however deputy assistant director technical service division following range loss problem described  motorola dvpdes data encryption standard system loss range penalty effectiveness digital voice privacy experience six city demonstrated equal existing geographic coverage  increase called fixed station equipment eg repeater cross band site backbone equipment  much fbi difficults seems lack proper management according gao report  uring review could find evidence long range plan nationwide dvp program prepared fbi official confirmed written plan exist fbi contends feasable prepare formal plan dvp program within time manpower constraint followup discussion response report fbi official emphasized dvp threat driven system told u management decision go full speed ahead rather plan fbi trying solve problem frequency hopping radio according daniel miller contracting officer fbi ph
