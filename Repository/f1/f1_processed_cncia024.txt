introduction give control nation currency care make law mayer amschel rothschild today silent weapon technology outgrowth simple idea discovered succinctly expressed effectively applied quoted mr mayer amschel rothschild mr rothschild discovered missing passive component economic theory known economic inductance course think discovery thcentury term sure mathematical analysis wait second industrial revolution rise theory mechanic electronics finally invention electronic computer could effectively applied control world economy table content general energy concept study energy system always appears three elementary concept potential energy kinetic energy energy dissipation corresponding concept three idealized essentially pure physical counterpart called passive component science physical mechanic phenomenon potential energy associated physical property called elasticity stiffness represented stretched spring electronic science potential energy stored capacitor instead spring property called capacitance instead elasticity stiffness science physical mechanic phenomenon kinetic energy associated physical property called inertia mass represented mass flywheel motion electronic science kinetic energy stored inductor magnetic field instead mass property called inductance instead inertia science physical mechanic phenomenon energy dissipation associated physical property called friction resistance represented dashpot device convert energy heat electronic science dissipation energy performed element called either resistor conductor term  resistor  one generally used describe ideal device eg wire employed convey electronic energy efficiently one location another property resistance conductor measured either resistance conductance reciprocal economics three energy concept associated economic capacitance capital money stockinventory investment building durables etc economic conductance good production flow coefficient economic inductance service influence population industry output mathematical theory developed study one energy system eg mechanic electronics etc immediately applied study energy system eg economics table content mr rothschild energy discovery mr rothschild discovered basic principle power influence control people applied economics principle  assume appearance power people soon give  mr rothschild discovered currency deposit loan account required appearance power could used induce people inductance people corresponding magnetic field surrendering real wealth exchange promise greater wealth instead real compensation would put real collateral exchange loan promissory note mr rothschild found could issue note backing long someone stock gold persuader show customer mr rothschild loaned promissory note individual government would create overconfidence would make money scarce tighten control system collect collateral obligation contract cycle repeated pressure could used ignite war would control availability currency determine would win war government agreed give control economic system got support collection debt guaranteed economic aid enemy debtor profit derived economic methodology mad mr rothschild able expand wealth found public greed would allow currency printed government order beyond limit inflation backing precious metal production good service table content apparent capital  paper  inductor structure credit presented pure element called  currency  appearance capital effect negative capital hence appearance service fact indebtedness debt therefore economic inductance instead economic capacitance balanced way balanced negation population war genocide total good service represent real capital called gross national product currency may printed level still represent economic capacitance currency printed beyond level subtractive represents introduction economic inductance constitutes note indebtedness war therefore balancing system killing true creditor public taught exchange true value inflated currency falling back whatever left resource nature regeneration resource mr rothschild discovered currency gave power rearrange economic structure advantage shift
