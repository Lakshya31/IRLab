comment fido time nov recent discussion problem proposed solution caused time zone daylight saving time similar natural disaster confused many way fear alone propose solution would unwise without surer grip problem want explore need requirement might better understand problem evaluate proposed solution excuse formality early step like firm base concerned party guess following two consumer two

corrected drift schedule change fido must restarted otherwise made aware change gotten correct far feel seriously hamper solution seems missing clear metaphor speaking locally term wall clock globally
