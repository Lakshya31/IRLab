 bomb trap  destruction genral written disaster master brother eye presentation bote well file discus different way making trap also talk different kind detonator disclaimer   neither member group held responsible damage chaos destruction done information file information purpose sure item discus           road trap walk trap book trap doorhandle trap loose floorboard trap assorted detonator road trap first trap discus basic road trap need wiretrap action complete electrical circuit extremely simple make since equipment gathered around house great advantage explode car directly insuring

pin one side ordinary clothes pin second wire directly connected positive terminal battery opposite metal pin clothes pin clothes pin must kept open small wooden wedge attached thin black wire rope stretched across road semi invisible wire pulled wedge pulled clothes pin thus closing clothes pin clothes pin closed two metal pin connect complete electrical circuit thus exploding charge walk trap incorporates type wiretrap action road trap walk trap electrically operated relies percussion detonator wire pilled pull safety pin heavy firing pin heat created detonator explosion sufficient set tnt type trap especially good dense forest area wire seen closeup bomb ground        pin detonator tnt book trap construct need large book perhaps thousand page book hollowed leaving edge intact hollow place put dry cell explosive connect wire fix two metal contact point edge book seperate wooden wedge attached rear wall bookcase must acomplished manner book removed shelf two metal contact point touch complete electrical circuit thus causing detonation explosive charge close book trap                metal contact explosive wooden wedge     battery        metal contact door handle trap two basic method boobytrapping door handle first employ short test tube cork two needle three wire one electrical blasting cap one metal ball bearing one stick dynamite two needle pushed cork equal length ball bearing placed tube test tube corked taped door handle wire connected eye two needle battery one wire going via blasting cap next battery stick dynamite taped back door handle turned ball bearing roll touch needle thus completing electrical circuit exploding dynamite second doorhandle trap much except us mercury thermostat switch rather ball bearing closeup ball bearing mercury thermostat   slight slant       slight angle ball bearing touching needle mercury touching wire rember people normal turn handle outside clock wise motion make sure dont place detonator backwards floor board trap loose floorboard utilizes principle book trap relies two metal contact point touching complete electrical circuit beneath loose floorboard two strip pliable metal bamboo metal contact point touch preasure brought loose floorboard close loose floorboard loose board bamboo           assorted detonator well many kind detonator discus three file well common fuse usually blackpowder core surronded fabric layer water resistent material however many different type generally said safety fuse burn second foot however check figure make purchase bomb detonated many way detonation use certain device based mainly cleverness imagination saboteur well next detonation device discus electrical detonator requires either solar igniter thin wire well piece wire make sure covered plastic except small part half inch connect wire battery side wire side battery wire get hot depending size amout battery using part covering get hottest teh part stick explosive many way use use imagination next type detonation device discus nonelectrical blasting cap need blasting cap alot powerful explosive like tnt blasting cap low explosive compound connected high explosive purpose detonating use nonelectrical blasting cap one gently push fuse hollow end fully crimp metal end around fuse put high explosive fuse burn ignites flash charge turn explodes priming charge detonates base charge finally creates enough heat set high explosive charge fuse ordinary safety fuse already discussed detonating cord fuse put blasting cap necessary seal act sealing called crimping involved sort thing one must use standard precaution crimper look like pair pliars function similiar although plier used crimping crimper right hand blasting cap left slowly squeez hollow end blasting cap may detonate closeup blasting cap hollow copper shell flash charge primary charge   base charge well thats question suggestion get touch palace aecat furbbs sure look next file called  bomb trap ii  got information book  anarchist cookbook  common knowledge feel free pas file around make sure keep credit intact brother eye bote silicon slave do buster rag big time
