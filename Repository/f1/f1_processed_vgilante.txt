seemed would stand tarva instead picked bag threw empty bunk  sir  said tarva  everyone must make sacrifice mr dolittel  responded said  computer   working  replied generic female voice  commander tarva requesting complete ship uniform  gave size particular  going wait placed order two come back far  said tall blonde chime rang another gang said must approached drawer looked screen saw tarva

slim fact today crew assigned vigilante arrive leaf unique position selecting staff relatively small pool volunteer  gone record personnel assigned vigilante personally selected assignment crew member decision easy someone navigator engineer specific rank basically fall place top command staff never easy however chief engineer chief security others require little intuitive thought  paused check skinny man tricorder   tarva thought  would nt telling nt getting chief security   reason telling  said turning attention back  difficult choice make chief security man named simon norton boarding soon get thing fixed head security three different star ship recently galaxy class giving volunteer mission know man desire command position one best come security  tarva could feel world shaking sure getting position never occurred someone credential would volunteer blind suicide mission like rumored  know may slightly disappointing commander  major understatement seemed know  could nt however put someone record diverse background ordinary position chosen first officer congratulation   thank sir  managed utter complete shock done purpose set fall pushed edge caught last millisecond man vicious sense humor going really enjoy working  commander work one position nt filled yet chief engineer several qualified personnel  captain anthony pointed mess around sweeping gesture  suppose good time make decision first assignment get mess working give call ready continue transfer process   sir nt enterprise transport remainder  tarva asked took whole transporter room  order keep minimum distance need power transporter two pad one ship currently work decide chief engineer get thing working got working everybody going make meeting  captain anthony left room eight white coveralled workman looking tarva door slid completely shut first officer tarva hand intercom  lieutenant commander dolittel report transporter room two immediately       transporter room ii soon filled tarvas roommate

approached troublesome transporter pad turned commander tarva running diagnostics transporter control panel  first officer tarva crystal cembera chief engineer charge construction vigilante glad finally able join u te   glad finally  said tarva  could help chief engineer get thing line  doctor cembera looked dolittel slight grin said  nt hard  dolittel cembera obviously history nt seem stop ignoring dolittel easily everybody else doctor cembera started running diagnostic transporter pointing certain detail new technology dolittel  main idea boost effective range three four time   great step forward  dolittel said  got largest transporter room mockup ever seen   next supply ship part need get three transporter room working properly  doctor cembera said ignoring dolittel comment  technology new taking quite get chip made   world get two pad work still waiting chip   make chip   probably failed  dolittel muttered  two pad working  said still ignoring comment  long exhausting job guess something came loose  doctor cembera crawled pad disappeared working soon emerged pad handed dolittel blackened fistsized component  pad figured power related since run computer circuitry  said reached panel opened near wall panel contained several different kind part obviously spare retreated back transporter pad came back said  ok fire  dolittel pressed couple button transporter lit right  well  said  look like ive got bit learn effective chief engineer   well nt worry seem good teacher  tarva said  quite even ready begin space trial  cembera added said  come john ill give tour engine room   one new style dilithium   dolittel could heard saying door slid shut behind tarva frowned realized dolittel walked dismissed people arrived would make sure proper star fleet regulation maintained pressed intercom button  commander tarva captain anthony transporter back line sir   thank commander  replied  right please inform enterprise back line       tarva tall blonde room mate working transporter control turned top rated operator happened last group transporting enterprise general abort warning issued engineering warning almost immediately followed massive power surge nt

captain picard sat ready room image captain anthony monitor front anthony several drop blood face looked slightly ill behind anthony worker red stained white coverall cleaning blood wall view tight anthony worker occasionally visible  ever happened  picard thought  unlike transporter accident ever heard ever new technology using project radically new dangerous   according record ensign shertz primary navigator  anthony saying  without anybody currently qualified position captain picard aware ship like enterprise likely several officer qualified fill position   captain anthony  picard said  suggesting assign one junior officer project    reply  merely suggesting may someone crew qualified position also fall criterion willing volunteer given chance  picard thought second said  put request qualified personnel   trust decision let know youve found navigator anthony  screen immediately went black picard sat staring silence minute said  computer list ship personnel qualified navigator star ship   working  generic female voice said immediately displayed list name  delete personnel married known living family  three name remained list commander data ensign janice omalley ensign ro laren captain picard sat looked three name neatly printed black screen would knew mission project would jump chance however regulation could tell extremely dangerous mission perhaps even suicide mission three officer knew one three qualified project would certainly volunteer picard decided post general notice thirty original list perhaps slight chance one felt could replace would volunteer would cross bridge came strictly volunteer mission could make anyone anyway feel obligated volunteer within minute posting notice signal door commander data  sir  said  notice believe logical choice fill navigator position unless count lore living relative know star fleet recognize next kin   data  picard said  expecting tried figure way turn request without giving little information project decided however properly satisfy must fill little information  five minute later data left ready room fully satisfied would extremely hazardous transfer project left passed red haired ensign omalley way meet captain occurred list qualified navigator good true janice thought walked see captain picard chance transfer secrete project dangerous mission good boring star charting hauling diplomat around ensign ro taking every time getting interesting tour ended would surely assigned primary navigator somewhere  sir  said almost door closed behind  volunteer navigator position   yes one  said  however upon close scrutiny record decided appropriate assignment  picard sat back watched face light excitement  sir respectfully request transfer   ensign omalley feel obligation tell little mission  picard said  notice always stated hazardous duty however since approaching last minute replacement think know consider suicide mission   sir suicide mission  omalley said quite taken aback  say said hazardous people know consider suicide mission   think sir  asked still bit confused captain picard trying say  work well worth cost  said  else say personal interest success mission  picard took deep breath looked beautiful young woman standing front large gray eye looked back expectantly finally said  still interested arrange transportation go start packing gear   thank sir  said snapped attention  dismissed  said ensign janice omalley turned sharply exited ready room left captain jeanluc picard looked personal file screen whole conversation noted time circumstance adoptive father death wolf  look like date destiny time life  said closed door      finally happening getting look side forbidden horizon janice could feel great apprehension though stepping unknown always bit scary could feel pulse race anticipation packed belonging third string navigator ship never rated larger quarter ensign omalley however woman possession vega nothing else taught approach life minimalist belonging really nt care larger billet last thing packed old style picture frame picture father taken first visit earth still young maybe fifteen earth year old considered child yet quite woman standing front ancient ruin country father claimed family name originated wrapped picture carefully uniform placed case possession would always treasured wondered would transfer new assignment survivor transporter incident transpoted odd looking shuttle wondered would send way back get nt really sure happened transporter something gone wrong end someone navigator killed expect transporter working anytime soon current distance enterprise could transport chief obrien voice came intercom  ensign omalley please report transporter room gear   thought  said chief obrien upon entering transporter room  unable transport got system back line   thought thing  said  gave new coordinate different transporter apparently shut unused area brought back line help tie loose end enterprise departure  janice hesitated stepping onto transporter pad though done many time never immediately following fatal accident looked obrien smiled nodded head stepped onto pad stood attention waited enterprise transporter room dissolved around replaced smaller spartan room front behind transporter control stood man white coverall  welcome e four space dock  said  well ready transport ship minute  right janice could see large space station style window vantage point thought could see hull ship  would like take look new assignment  man asked ensign janice omalley put bag place stepped window outside something never seen star ship space dock unlike star ship though small older style saucer section dwarfed four new galaxy style warp engine saucer attached directly bulbous main body without usual neck lifting away impulse engine appeared raised main body behind saucer thing wrong color nt standard star fleet white dull gray name number designation anywhere seen clear view top saucer section anomaly antenna pod miss placed orifice etc indicative either old style saucer new style engine anything else matter   asked man standing next also admiring ship  called us vigilante  said  kind name star ship  asked really expecting answer  nt ask  said  work transporter   hope nt running transporter last time  said slight smile  sir  said  besides caused power surge engineering  signal intercom  whelp captain ready time report duty  said  guess  said returned transporter small transporter room dissolved view time replaced much larger one front stood man long grayblack hair thinning top pulled back pony tail wore slightly baggy black uniform several large pocket though wore obvious insignia man must kind authority could move stood attention said  ensign janice louise omalley reporting duty sir   welcome aboard us vigilante ensign  man black said  captain anthony bring personal file   yes sir  said handed small computer disk outside pocket bag  good  said slipped disk tricorder holding  leave bag delivered quarter right late already postponed meeting please come  left finally noticed several people blood stained white coverall vigorously cleaning transporter room another clean coverall approached bag soon left transporter pad also noticed personal pad left shattered blackened could feel nausea catch throat ever happened must horrifying corridor men white coverall hard work many area exposed superstructure could see several deck framing one point edge along exposed girder keep falling next deck area work man given hard hat wear passing  nt late would taken safer longer route  captain said edged along beam finally arrived shuttle bay filled hundred black uniformed crew ensign omalley never thought would feel place federation star ship uniform surrounded crew dressed baggy black uniform definitely felt place captain walked short dark skinned woman high klingon type forehead long braid hair back  ensign omalley  said first officer commander tarva  commander tarva  janice said greeting commander tarva nodded said  least lasted longer last navigator   attention please  captain said loud speaker  like personally welcome aboard fulton class star ship us vigilante unique craft ever conceived star fleet  like say remind mission volunteered intent extended hazardous duty mission may tour several year little contact star fleet fact many analyst believe heard want reflect minute tell exact destination transfer shore leave vigilante mission completed  second thought leave collect belonging report transporter room enterprise currently standing start way back last assignment  stirring among crew sunk several group discussed amongst finally three individual stepped forward announced second thought  well  captain anthony said  want thank dedication got far returned previous position mention incident appear record must also remind never talk project detail considered top secret also anybody persists questioning must reported star fleet security finally must never even discus project amongst self leave ship never happened clear   yes sir  said together  dismissed  captain anthony said watched three exit shuttle bay  may guessed us vigilante ship peace  captain anthony began  ship war war right war vigilante designed take war enemy order hasten construction vigilante part used destruction first battle enemy face one strongest irresistible federation ever faced enemy going meet borg  revelation slight murmur rose crowd finally voice came crowd  sir expect accomplish ship destroyed fighting one borg cube plan attack one ship made junked part gotten  captain anthony smiled reaction expected since one project committee got originally approached star fleet  listen  said  superstructure maybe made old part however technology put ship cutting edge every area notice part function recognize whole ship become proving ground radical new idea job test use new idea  already know use new component vigilante thing may go wrong accepted mission best confident working designer vigilante learn new technology become confident ability actually pull  sure also aware borg ability gain knowledge computer prisoner therefore imperative unnecessarily discus function department department new design area ship technology know borg attribute federation  another unique feature vigilante computer system though central computer day day need life star ship area separate computer system system totally inaccessible central computer create problem galaxy class star ship actually operated five crew member automated mode vigilante need fifty highly trained crew keep maneuvering warp  bit exaggeration wanted keep toe ever may pas toe  crew received assignment work construction personnel preparing vigilante duty know lot work left little time certain work together ship ready schedule also expect know ship inside first space trial let get work dismissed       simon norton entered meeting room last usual great propensity late never seemed however nt fault transporter failed twice ever got aboard ship last time left stranded enterprise trip vigilante eye opener transport sent retrieve mean shuttle troop carrying drop ship designed rapid deployment personnel transporter protected landing zone star fleet antiterrorist unit carried kind ship even carried standard shuttle craft strange chief security star ship idea design didnt know class layout knew something different large size shuttle bay told also narrow corridor small room suggested something different vigilante wished drop ship window captain anthony sitting small room command staff commander norton finally got around joining room like rest ship painted gray drab color middle room large dark gray table straight edge slightly bowed fit bow room around

white coverall construction worker sitting next dolittel commander norton unable find information construction personnel computer file distressed felt best know everyone dealing  ah commander norton  captain said  glad finally able join u believe familiar everybody except doctor cembera doctor cembera chief engineer charge design construction vigilante   doctor  commander norton said slightly bowed bald head towards took seat close door  meeting intended fill specific us vigilante  said captain anthony pushed button computer terminal terminal main screen detailed picture ship appeared began rotate slowly  believe leave lecture doctor cembera   thank captain  doctor cembera said stood approached screen  us vigilante designed three main feature mind speed fire power stealth quickly build ship decided necessary use space frame deposited memory alpha part used fact taken ship destroyed borg however completely refitted ship new technology material used hull drive system  start hull original skin component removed replaced new composite material material much le penetrable detectable known encountered scanning device make u virtually invisible long range scanner appear much smaller closer range sensor window however made new material window fitted old style blast shield power main deflector ever lost window without blast shield would extremely vulnerable detection  known fact star fleet policy use cloaking device ship policy however preclude research cloaking technology main goal cloaking research develop adequate detection cloaked ship research added learned klingons believe created sophisticated cloaking system ever implemented technology installed vigilante together new hull material call combined system act advanced cloaking technology act vigilante completely invisible borg others matter  commander norton interrupted  star fleet policy cloaking get whole ship built around cloaking technology   star fleet regulation little influence ship officially exist  responded captain anthony norton sat back contemplate implication captain said doctor cembera continued  next obvious feature vigilante  said  number warp drive new technology alignment four engine jump vigilante warp  subwarp speed le second able hold warp  extended period time next   excuse doctor  lt commander dolittel said  yes mr dolittel  doctor cembera said bit frown anticipating coming next  led team extensive research new technology alignment call  dolittel said  concluded year ago create uncontrollable worm hole around ship using   true  commander tarva asked  yes  doctor cembera replied  saying built whole ship around theory already proven flawed  tarva next question  next topic  doctor cembera said  may continue think able answer question   please continue doctor  captain said knowing coming next  lieutenant commander dolittel conclusion absolutly correct  stressed lieutenant knowing much elusive promotion irritated  technology tend produce uncontrollable worm hole since taking mr dolittel team started elimination worm hole effect plagued scientist long ago discussing problem colleague front young daughter daughter actually came idea made possible  said proudly doctor cembera audience looked blankly continued ignoring look  daughter asked nt control worm hole tell truth never occurred mainly travel warp generated worm hole extremely unpleasant  word unpleasant couple people took second look restraint chair began realize cembera getting  worm hole also throw ship many light year course control worm hole get deposit u want go even unpleasant effect could quite useful word could get worm hole place u minute may take u year warp nine reach   keep using word u planning join u planned journey  dolittel  use word merely figure speech sir  doctor cembera answered crisply continued  implemented new drive older test ship dubbed us fulton like technology using involves complete replacement main system plus extensive reworking system result extremely promising fulton ended within desired sector however bit side effect caused worm hole great deal outer hull ruptured transit however effect vigilante since technology refined great deal hull shield strength greatly increased  finally number modification shield generator weapon transporter make vigilante actually several generation advanced even galaxy class star ship   nt think bit optimistic last statement  dolittel said cembera reclaimed seat   tarva interjected  think couple generation enough defeat borg live   allow answer  captain anthony said  mission defeat borg rather collect extensive information hope able defeat next time arrive little arm galaxy okay question  captain anthony doctor cembera began field question different aspect mission detail ship meeting commander tarva examined commander norton medium sized humanoid bit shorter captain anthony solid build size due much genetics obvious attempt part maintain highly muscled physique could see highly defined muscle reaching neck even appeared face muscled ear pointed forehead slightly pronounced like romulan tarva background told man least part romulan background also told romulanvulcan trait extremely dominant needed one hiding somewhere family tree show kind feature another oddity man totally bald head obvious least shaved head consistent culture could readily attribute      ensign janice omalley piloted gray drop ship one tau epsilon far asteroid field next sat cocky acting young man white coverall named picback properly strapped seat turned slightly leaned back could place foot empty area control panel  still nt see flying around  said  navigator shuttle pilot   first shuttle  picback said smile  highly sophisticated troop drop ship second understanding nt much need navigator vig time third navigator trained pilot thing pilot navigate time guess trying make earn keep  something besides rock appeared scanner  must target  picback said  remember cloaking ca nt see u keep distance nt want running u dropping package  position could watch tug disconnect cargo pod placing close proximity large asteroid lifted away could clearly read name number us chandrasekher nccc sensor told intense sensor sweep area   asked picback  instruction strict leave cargo detects activity area  replied extremely bored whole process ensign omalley continued track tug hightailed system tug entered warp began approach cargo pod picback sat normal position began work control drop ship slowly approached giant cargo pod soon dwarfed  thing look longer vigilante  said omalley moved ever closer pod  well originally designed haul couple galaxy style warp engine around room spare last delivery  picback said powered magnetic cargo coupling retrofitted drop ship  suppose  janice asked companion trying make conversation  know regs  said smile  allowed discus matter directly related job make small talk anything drop ship flying one believe even allowed discus detail specifically related current assignment  dissertation janice laughed said  could said nt know  coupling clanged place slightly jolting ship  okay  picback said  ease power slowly tub lot powerful wimpy star fleet shuttle remember lot mass   mr picback fresh academy  ensign omalley said slightly irritated  maneuvered enterprise asteroid field occasion   enterprise deflector shield probably gave quite bit room error huh  picback returned jerked forward    slipped accelerator bit  ensign said  slip accelerator bit  picback said worryingly  better let control done lot   nt worry  janice said slight grin picback nt notice  handle  pulled back control stick start maneuver arc asteroid field  know quite time since piloted anything control stick   nt tell hooked monster  picback said trying show panic starting feel  tried  janice said  said earn keep late huh  sounded trying panic nt help picback new state mind proximity warning began flash scanner console ahead seemed ram rather large orange asteroid picback locked arm leg shut eye bracing collision never occurred  happened  said enough time passed hit asteroid  right  ensign omalley said smile  thing lot wider turning radius used  passed two extremely close asteroid proximity warning flashed picback time react clear field  whew  janice said feigned wiping sweat forehead  nt think make last one  picback could sit hope didnt draw red head partner huge cargo pod sped space obvious mean propulsion drop ship remained cloaked approached te ensign omalley placed cargo predetermined orbit velocity orbit precise inorder eventually get pod matching orbit space dock idea place pod high orbit brake matching orbit dock braking since passing orbit sphere te drop high orbit begin heavy braking hopefully space dock would catch reached orbit untrained observer would thought procedure easy one cargo pod entered high orbit began making increasingly lower orbit space dock eventually pod seemed drop space space dock maneuvered place top framing directly vigilante picback omalley gone two day four hour maneuvered ship shuttle bay soon ship came rest airlock door flew open picback jumped fell knee kissed deck man black crew uniform

slowly descending drop ship stair lowered place combed back short red hair slightly messed long trip carried uniform jacket casually one shoulder walked put jacket fastened properly reached handed ship log  wrong technician ensign  asked  idea sir guess little high strung  said bit smile taragoma checked log looked young woman standing  okay dismissed  said  thank sir  chief smiled watched walk thought  knew problem cloaking thing routine mission       captain anthony stood large round dimly lit chamber around worker white coverall went business room appeared unfinished massive connecter

turbolift came hole floor two turbo lift channel room cable net strung across preventing anybody inadvertently stepping open hole rough side turbo lift visible single door slid open commander tarva moved net aside walked captain anthony stood attention reached said  captain   yes  said second coming back thought  sir construction advises bridge included new shipment  tarva said  well hope  anthony said smile  tell get installed soon possible star ship without bridge like phaser without trigger  tarva flipped open looked like old style communicator relayed captain order stepped turbo lift tarva ridden  sir  asked captain  long till expect start moving bridge place  captain anthony asked answering question  estimate everything ready six hour  said  deck six  said lift looked time piece  commander would care join supervising installation us vigilante bridge  asked  yes sir   meet air lock two bring pressure suit gear   good sir  said stepped lift deck six commander tarva looked time piece five hour nothing pressing needing immediate attention would good time go back cabin rest bit gotten minimum rest since leaving enterprise need  deck eight  said lift      tarva sat cabin short black silken robe long sleeve sitting bottom robe seemed barely touch seat chair black sheathed knife still strapped right shin water droplet tarva combing long wet hair one side head front leaning forward leg slightly spread allowing hair fall floor bare foot roommate found came tarva looked scowled  got get cabin   commander nt expect soon  said chief swanson  even first officer take time awhile  replied stressing title  thought youd working new shipment  said whole group engineer still combing hair  intention sir  dolittel said formally broke boot liner gear pressure suit  rest however transporter engineer wait till get bridge way  dolittel saw tarva continue frown others continued make comfortable  perhaps  said  could begin preparing transporter room three receive new chip ready   sound like good idea mr dolittel  tarva said finally losing frown smiling others greatly ranked nt even question weather order suggestion picked headed back door  mr dolittel  tarva said last leave  yes sir  said  would inform roommate appointment  said curtly immediately turned back brushing hair  yes sir  repeated walked  mean  one companion asked dolittel  mean ca nt go back quarter  another one said  mean  said dolittel  find something   say could prepare transporter room new chip spent last twelve hour  said chief swanson  got every right use cabin matter roommate right kick u nt suppose tolerant cabin ready even first officer  said first  nt get  dolittel said  long four day little often seen commander tarva cabin  three looked shrugged dolittel continued  tell twice including first day fact bunk nt touched know remember made two people make bunk exactly way mean go since got complaining twelve hour want go keep busy eight hour get rest hour going begin installing new transporter chip clear   yes sir  said unison  good first make sure spread word three  lt commander john dolittel like pulling rank team occasionally remind still military mission      smoke

captain anthony said giving phaser back norton  material different hull much denser cell structure disperses much energy heat reason hull made take ten time current hull material make suit material protect even suit also built deflector shield  anthony pointed life support pack  nm suit extended life support range five day built maneuvering jet suppose even better space walk pack use  commander norton decided speak  suit made basically material hull mean scanner penetrate  captain anthony smiled said  tell anybody want find  little discussion decided commander norton first try new suit took

marvelous device strapped piece around neck fit like piece jewelry  piece suppose  said rest room smiled recognized question heard language still  device translates rest u inconveniencing slightly rest crew wear translator u  captain said  rest introduction  captain continued indicated short dark skinned female creature standing next  first officer commander tarva  sir utlin looked creature almost looked normal forehead rolled slightly hair started top head looked like cross child linhrlar even uglier creature standing considered moment decided since indicated second command would treat

event  nt know much decision weighs staff u personally affected borg  anthony shook kind memory  duty people depending u return information may able use defeat borg  valiantly engage hopeless battle would betrayed whole federation depending u best return intelligence need  anthony looked sir utlin carefully hoping see sort understanding utlin sat back considered captain anthony argument tried put place warrior tough understand sitting battle perhaps point put one civilization another dying one caring need civilization  suppose  utlin said slowly  understand reason would cause stay battle  hesitated continued  also understand pain helplessness warrior must felt  said sir utlin suddenly felt closeness people inner conflict must endure prayed linhrlar would look  cleared  commander tarva said  must make decision    sir utlin tried best talk female creature captain anthony spoke tarva could answer  sir utlin must excuse duty must attend   fully understand captain  sir utlin said stood

spoke  said decision make first like permission examine repair fighter finally reach destination may wish use   mean nt examined yet  sir utlin sounded slightly surprised tarva smiled  done without touching strict instruction respect property   personal property like retrieve technician start working  utlin decided see far could push  good going figure several option could chose wish  tarva said remaining business like  get chose fate  sir utlin asked surprised  course want among u want brings u first option could repair craft send way  sir utlin frowned thought literally place go  wish could take borg let fight battle guess similar first option  tarva mentioning option knowing full well sir utlin probably would nt seriously consider  le drastic option  asked giving lead continue  take observer vigilante  tarva said  therefore chose remain join crew crew made diverse number different people different culture chose join u accept accept mission goal however try work find position worthy skill experience sound acceptable   like  asked  know trust wo nt work agenda  tarva leaned forward sir utlin could see fire creature eye sent chill spine  stand part crew part team room deal infraction harshest manner  sir utlin keep swallowing hard perhaps would better  future wish leave vigilante   long departure would adversely effect mission could prevent tendering resignation  tarva said simply  time think  sir utlin asked perhaps sometime get better feel people  course nt know borg get going may time become proper member crew next emergency   risk    tarva said  let get set

across screen apparent movement caused vigilante evasive maneuver without computer stabilization picture would complete blur  two  someone wondered aloud coded clearance appeared commander tarva screen captain  commander norton fire control target closest cube prepare delivery sequence shelbyone  said without turning attention command screen second command vigilante commander tarva given many firing code instead captain attempt decentralize command case capture  commander hold fire  captain said  helm increase speed warp nine point three  captain anthony hoping vigilante could get away borg without fight knew could nt defeat borg wanted avoid leaving system fire fight vigilante increased speed lieutenant serlet spoke  captain may able   vigilante shook violently lurched hard port soon ship started shake commander tarva started yelling  fire fire  vigilante released stream photon torpedo directly borg ship behind time beamed dozen specially prepared torpedo directly interior ship torpedo fired cube minimal effect served distraction torpedo beamed strategic location throughout structure photon torpedo exploded predefined pattern called shelby sequence commander shelby one foremost authority borg suggested main power conduit could disrupted exactly right pattern could create feedback resonance would destroy ship borg immediately started experiencing trouble dropped warp vigilante trouble one noticed one pursuer dropped light year behind star ship dropped speed spun wildly course  maintain warp  captain anthony yelled  continue evasive maneuver engineering status  tarva cross talked captain ordering targeting second cube  sustained damage warp nacelle one  came commander dolittel voice engineering  unable establish transporter lock cube interior  commander norton reported added  shield seventy five percent cloaking operative   damage stableized  dolittel echoed background  holding warp nine  helm reported commotion  hell happened  captain demanded

minute   shiv  captain anthony said loudly started entering new command console  helm entering new course   aye sir  came simple reply  engage  vigilante immediately dropped warp changed heading straight instant ship continued old course saucer section pointing closer cube immediately light year beyond ship also shooting vigilante used acceleration advantage jumping directly warp  time held straight course trying put much distance borg possible  bridge  came dolittel voice engineering  dont know maintain speed damaged nacelle might hold   wo nt long  captain replied  prepare controlled worm hole  anthony finished speaking vigilante shudder light flickered  sir losing speed  ensign omalley reported  engineering  captain yelled intercom whats going  lost nacelle one  dolittel reported  nacelle two also line  resonance synchronization problem warp nacelle could operated matched pair  recelebrating two nacelle operation  last maneuver borg become extremely strung precise location vigilante one ship area able zero interference radiation generated failing nacelle ship approached slowly still unable pin point intruder  stop  captain anthony commanded  initiate jamming  tarva said watched ship approach jamming device designed blind borg scanner mask borg link vigilante drifted borg ship passed area crew watched borg main view screen silence ship passed beyond vigilante still within jamming range turned back anthony signalled engineering  full speed   full speed  came dolittel reply  acceleration effected slightly wo nt able hold top speed indefinitely   controlled wormhole  tarva put  aye still operational  dolittel returned approaching vigilante position borg began intense offfrequency sensor sweep area cube wasnt heading directly toward ship would pas extremely close  prepare jump warp nine point six command  anthony told crew borg passed beyond closest point ship came dead stop sensor vigilante told whole area intense study borg crew leaned forward watching borg closely wait see passed jump hope run  maintain nine point six well  captain anthony said commander tarva looked questioningly  let see pas helm prepared warp get closer   sir ready power buildup closest face cube  serlet reported  get u  anthony said tractor beam sprang borg ship aimed directly damaged nacelle vigilante jumped warp nine point six time avoid beam borg immediately took pursuit  prepare controlled worm hole  anthony commanded  got get triangulate u  vigilante rocked borg latched tractor beam beam locked solidly deflector shield around disabled nacelle  established tractor beam lock dropping warp  commander norton reported  targeting weapon   fire  anthony said  get u  first time ever vigilante phasers fired anger high powered phaser bank fired rippling effect cloaking heavy damage cube superstructure tractor beam held tight time vigilante torpedo delivery system targeted cube launched torpedo aimed source tractor beam sight taking damage phasers tractor beam area heavily shielded torpedo significant damage heavy damage continued inflicted area phasers could reach beam held tight internally torpedo beamed couldnt achieve shelby sequence noticeable damage another beam came borg ship high powered cutting beam immediately struck shield top nacelle next tractor beam vigilante shuddered lost power many low priority system computer tried maintain shield  shield forty five percent  commander norton reported  disengage cloaking  captain anthony said  save energy know   current rate shield fail five minute  commander norton said  sir  serlet  yes  captain said quickly glance toward young vulcan  may able escape shield fail   explain   borg still nt dealt vigilante hull material energy absorbing nature tractor beam may effective bare hull  captain looked security chief  think   solid hypothesis based current data  norton said  data conclusive   cutting beam  commander tarva asked  oh  serlet said almost nonchalantly  take direct hit engine room one  tarva immediately signaled evacuation engine room one emergency lock engine room two personnel evacuated engine room one non essential personnel engine room two remaining personnel stayed rough duty chair would automatically drop safety emergency knew would nt happen since er two failed would safety  prepare drop shield  anthony commanded  helm engineering ready warp soon cut rear shield  captain anthony sat back braced could sense rest bridge crew ship tense light dimmed power strain two beam phaser torpedo fire continued pour vigilante considerably le effect vigilante dropped rear shield light seemed brighten instant immediately however cutting beam hit craft amid ship near saucer section much energy dissipated hull engine room one still engulfed fire explosion borg tractor beam much le focused needed time adjust new target vigilante needed instantly sight borg single minded immediately took strange little ship commander dolittel several technician worked feverishly engine room control center looked area evacuated engine room one engulfed flame high power electrical discharge instant borg struck ship function already diverted engine room two vigilante still felt massive power loss damage second strike commander dolittel closed blast shield control room engine room one failing monitor watched one two advanced engine room star fleet burn another problem started shutting alpha warp core soon evacuation ordered nt nearly enough time team could release energy building damaged coil knew matter minute total breach siren howled around commander dolittel signaled bridge  le two minute warp core breach  reported  prepare ejection alpha warp core anti matter pod  dolittel glanced stats beta core pushing

implement worm hole control   read five borg ship closing fast  serlet reported background  nt care control  anthony yelled bearded face monitor  get u  nearest borg ship close enough fire vigilante sustained sufficient damage effect targeting system first burst energy missed vigilante would use miss adjust sighting ensign omalley trying run setup routine worm hole console next getting response suddenly ship filled loud siren none recognized first ten second warning wormhole dolittel ride every safety precaution built controlled wormhole easy working engineering main console captain nt seem care went long away dolittel quite agreed strapping rough duty seat looked engine room watched crew scramble chair  god hope make  thought frowned  god hope make  hit brick wall least felt like captain anthony nt sure happened everything flew felt crush chair bridge wrapped around began spiral front looked like long tunnel view screen star far end tunneling felt like drilling hole body felt like would blown apart vigilante purposely breached alignment warp coil pursuing borg ship extremely close artificial wormhole created breach sucked large borg ship starship sized corridor cube collapsed like water flowing funnel      pain surged everybody vigilante felt like every blood vessel body exploded captain anthony gasped breath fumbled release restraint bridge almost black except faint red emergency lighting wormhole control system emergency power cut offs case accident may disabled implement maneuver captain anthony felt extremely light headed nt know injury loss gravity got restraint removed tried stand felt like seat dropped away nt free fall gravity minimal  bridge engineering  captain said looking around bridge  status  bridge crew slowly gaining consciousness debris hung ceiling littered deck  bridge engineering report  anthony tried still response captain anthony made one bridge engineering station tried run diagnostics  bridge station report  came commander tarvas voice behind anthony captain looked back first officer neglected bridge crew knowing status ship important one short kalonian working free restraint trying raise rest ship time diagnostics nt look good minimal power looked safety ride worm hole totally shut beta warp core  nt good  captain anthony said softly bridge crew slowly gaining consciousness commander tarva able raise several section vigilante engineering   anthony said  get away borg  answer question vigilante rocked great thud whole crew scrambled support looked trying show fear feeling ship rocked   antony demand  attack  crew tried every station answer none responded power loss total external sensor ship rocked third time captain anthony commander tarva scrambled command room prying door open contend blast shield manual control designed emergency maintenance getting one shield half open small area looking across rear ship vigilante floated blackness pin point light distant star nt enough tell  contact drop bay  anthony said  yes sir  tarva replied  tell turn emergency landing beacon might give u enough light see  another thudding sound echoed ship  commander kartang report minute worth battery power  tarva report large communicator  plenty  anthony said tarva put communicator away bring tricorder leaned look window captain absence light even smallest amount seem like sun rise straight back light suddenly came hull dropped shuttle bay captain anthony commander tarva grimaced saw first right hull scorched black crack radiated center strike upper port nacelle large hole blown front shattered side wire debris dangled first saw sign hitting vigilante finally saw large chunk debris slowly float darkness glance side ship hit dull thud echoed starship soon hit light shuttle bay faded went  get  anthony asked  yes sir  tarva replied holding tricorder show clear picture object struck ship two headed bridge heard computer begin come back line tarva went straight serlet help identifying debris captain anthony tried signalling engineering intercom filled static step forward voice broke though  ridge comm  dolit  damage worm   casualty someower line  minute  dolittel speaking quickly get message communication lost captain anthony turned one technician nearby get find exactly status  turned someone else  try set computer link engineering maybe get information way   anybody tell yet  anthony said looking around whole bridge ensign omalley spoke  sir established link stellar cartography working location main computer still may take awhile   ok ensign keep working   sir  commander tarva  yes commander  tentatively identified debris saw  tarva reported   captain asked figured part vigilante could nt see  piece recorded fragment borg ship  tarva reported  also enhanced picture show space around u  tarva showed captain anthony tricorder screen showed vigilante floating cloud debris  apparently  serlet offered  cube followed u worm hole torn apart process  captain looked picture smiled  guess nt fit  ship rocked another strike  nt get shield back soon damned borg ship may still end u  anthony said frustration main light came everyone suddenly felt much le light headed  bridge engineering  came commander dolittels voice intercom  go ahead commander  tarva replied  main power back line shield eight percent sustained major damage drive system able repair  dolittel reported  currently working getting impulse drive back line get maneuverability back   warp drive  tarva asked  hard say commander able get nacelle three four line full capacity top speed probably around warp seven top sustainable speed around warp five   controlled worm hole  captain asked dryly  sir  commander dolittel returned  last jump controlled get   control worm hole high warp capability  captain anthony summarized  hope landed somewhere near federation else could long ride home  ensign omalley looked console glazed look eye  sir determined present location far side gamma quadrant   gamma quadrant  tarva asked disbelief  would go right alpha quadrant get  someone said  sir  serlet offered  high warp gamma quadrant eighty year federation space   thank lieutenant know  captain anthony said dropped heavily chair  know  find u place pity breast let u last embrace earth sunhallowed rest night claw upon brain oh see sun  sunshine  robert w service
