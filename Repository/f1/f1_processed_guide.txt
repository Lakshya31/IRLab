telenet enter dnic connect telenet host saw vax wanted look could type c ignored time node allows collect billed connection say connected possibly get identifying header username prompt nt allow

combination act like charge account telenet collect node nui junk password type following c junk   echoed screen problem nui hard come unless youre good social engineer thorough knowledge telenet case probably nt reading section someone provide second way connect use private pad either x pad something like netlink prime computer two prefix telenet nua oftentimes always refers phone area code computer located ie xxx would computer houston texas particular area interested say new york city could begin typing c cr connects make note go found interesting system play system simple xxx yyy

outdials network server pad  addition computer nua may connect several thing one useful outdial outdial nothing modem get telenet similar pc pursuit concept except nt password time connect get message

also ventel modem type display display five number stored macro modem memory also different type server remote local area network lan many machine office nation connected discus identifying later computer id section finally may connect something say x communication pad stuff followed new prompt pad like one except attempted connection billed pad allowing connect node earlier refused collect connection also added bonus confusing connecting packet transmitted pad pad contains header location calling instance first connected telenet might said connected called area code mean calling pad number area sent header packet leaving pad connect private pad however packet going address valuable buffer detection phone scanning  finally timehonored method computer hunting made famous among
