minimal rounded percentage term sound appealing effect claim amount second transfer minute hardly worth would nt agree page hydracom hydracom page bidirectional protocol add performance two direction course giving nice figure comparing unidirectional protocol really unfair hydra report separate figure file transfered stay conservative side trust performance rating transfer last le minute okay nt
