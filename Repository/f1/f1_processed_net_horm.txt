neglected computer system although could argued much easier computer system biological system currently tracing depends upon people reading report determining system subject infection performing diagnostic test determining treatment method obtaining software chancy time consuming requiring often people highest level expertise computer network speed infectious agent could spread network hour

rapidly damage noted much later consider worm constructed carry virus worm infects system installs virus infects nearby system net finally terminates erasing evidence existence first system virus also inapparent wait right moment writes bit terminates destroying evidence existence later worm retraces path read bit writes bit exit point inapparent infection could spread quite widely noticed also might hard determine whether system infected would done damage either immanent apparent analysis suggests response networkwide problem would best network level theory operation computer generate simplest case random number used label transaction transaction defined interaction capable transmitting infectious agent transaction system therefore unique label code transaction event system identified infected transaction code could represent transaction agent transmitted broadcast computer receiving computer matching code system alerted possibility agent presence broadcast transaction code accumulated suspect contact iterates process thus identifying carrier eventually effect model epidemiological process thereby identifying carrier forward backward transaction tracking stodolsky b c process infection control process broken routine alerting operation routine operation file transfer labeled way identify system involved label time stamped time stamp encoded written archive system ideally writeoncereadmany time device type storage could easily altered alerting procedure invoked infectious agent noted suspect transaction code received match one system archive earliest time agent could arrived system latest time usually moment agent noted received suspect transaction code matched could transmitted system used delimit suspect transaction code code broadcast alert system potential presence agent simplest common case system get alert indicates  could infected time one  system automatically package transaction code time one present time generate new alert indicating thing system contact another automatic response could immediately cut communication progress thus reducing risk infection benefit reaction would possibility disrupting transfer infectious agent disrupted agent would harmless easily identified evaluated reestablishment communication could occur immediately new procedure force could warn new user alert progress well limiting type transfer could take place  practical consideration direct identification opposed identification forward tracing notification delimit effectively earliest time agent could present system thus alert originating system could include transaction code written prior identification default value could generate excessive reaction network reaction could controlled another system later alert indicated originated infection system originating alert thus protection identity reduces inhibition reporting infection important type reaction discussed might called panic reaction excessive number system might notified potential infection first instance restricted response could generated person alert originating system analyzed causative agent thereby hopefully establishing earliest time agent could present system case suspect transaction could delimited effectively system could infected would notified would system transmitted agent system originating alert assuming one exists ideally notified system would able determine received originated infection respond accordingly  forward tracing assumption assume however rapid response desired notified system would react notified infection transmitted would package transaction code written later suspect transaction code received issue secondary alert forward tracing assumption would lead quite effective control exponential growth number infected host epidemic exponential growth alert resulting forward tracing system infect many others result single infective agent transmitted forward tracing would alert system alerting system could infected newly alerted system would also issue forward trace alert would continue containment reached forward tracing assumption  backward tracing suspect contact diagnosis result rapid forward tracing response likely active infection would identified resulting new information could used effectively characterize life cycle agent thereby hopefully permitting effectively delimited backward tracing also result accumulated information positive test agent would become available stage reached focus action could shift control suspect transaction control transaction known facilitate transmission agent feasibility efficiency technical social factor play key role operation control mechanism contact tracing probably effective sparsely interacting host rate transfer infectious agent compared rate transfer suspect transaction code also critical factor recording transaction comprehensive computer network however unregistered transaction factor case infectious agent identified type transaction capable transmitting agent delimited could increase efficiency  social organization alert another major efficiency factor error origination alert since protected message would trigger networkwide alert important false alarm controlled effectively hand failure report infection could permit infectious agent spread uncontrolled manner could increase number system unnecessarily alerted successful operation mechanism described assumes voluntary cooperation among affected system assumption could relaxed application enforcement mechanism would require substantially greater complexity greater centralization coordination word cooperation forthcoming  voluntarily  user would likely treated complicated restrictive resource intensive mechanism would developed enforce  estimate damage inflicted november internet infection alone ranged upward million mcafee  cost magnitude make likely even expensive enforcement mechanism developed made necessary simplest organizational strategy would assume protection identity needed would also likely inhibit alerting true anonymity however permit irresponsible behavior go unchecked reputation preserving anonymity pseudonymity would desirable ensure protection accountability thereby promote cooperation pseudonym would best property person association computer system even sincere cooperation however would eliminate inefficiency resulting false alarm failure alert inadequate training poor judgement likely source error user realize reputational cost associated failure likely motivated minimize false alarm already major problem user inexperience high level defect widely used software reputational mechanism would motivate increased user education careful software selection corresponding pressure software publisher produce well behaved carefully documented product  enforcing cooperation cryptoprotocols could used ensure noncooperator could communicate freely others using infection control mechanism type communication limiting could used routinely ensure system requesting connection infected effect system would exchange health certificate file exchange ensure would infected system could show health certificate could rejected conversation partner due risk infection would doubt enforce cooperation mechanism stodolsky beyond scope note  nonnetwork transfer discussion focused transfer network principle could applied disk tape transfer originating system would write transaction code medium file protection identity would possibly reduced type transfer since question directionality transmission infectious agent offline transfer non network transmission likely easier control several factor rate spread agent likely make infection le troublesome summary benefit idea behind net hormone make immanent danger apparent precisely net hormone permit visualization infection risk  control unidentified infectious agent net hormone work permitting isolation infectious host risk identification infectious agent required action therefore new yet unidentified agent effectively controlled  rapid response host could automatically respond alert determining involved suspect contact generate new alert would propagate along potential route infection  protection identity mechanism could function without releasing identity infected host could crucial case institution wish publicly know security system compromised case use unregistered software precisely software obtain untraceable anonymous file transfer could protected mechanism without release user identity  distributed operation operation
