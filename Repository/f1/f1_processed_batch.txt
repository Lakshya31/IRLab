useful example pretend large file word processing file containing bill pay time time need look bill amount file accountstxt plain ascii english text word processor do find utility search large file specific word string character general format find command find  text  filename find located file findcom do disk must present batch file used simple batch file possibly named getbat could echo echo searching data find   echo finished bos start batch file getbat search data like c get grocery accountstxt first word start getbat second word item search third item file search result get report line

format command goto label label line batch file must start colon followed name eight character long simple useless batch file illustrates goto command looping around circle task endlessly example listing batch file echo kitty echo watch fill screen folk goto kitty note version do necessary include one blank line end file example press enterreturn key one extra time line  goto kitty  save batch file batch file continue print remark line since always return start tap ctrlbreak stop silliness true usefulness goto command best understood allowing goto within batch file transfer control elsewhere within listing rather line immediately next sequence thus cause varying useful result depending condition present choice different outcome trademark savvy batch file use   allows conditional operation command fancy way saying cause batch file make decision based logical condition input something usual syntax command condition command let take apart examine concept situation condition command command normal do batch file command condition one three possible test yield true false example w goto dog explain bit example  mode bw explain bit three possible test errorlevel condition ie specific number found string comparison ie two string equivalent file existence condition ie file exists true fullfeatured programming language many logical test might allowed batch file three test let examine three closely illustrate example errorlevel number tell do whether last program run successful errorlevel zero anything else zero mean unsuccessful string comparison second conditional test always indicated batch file double equal sign  test designated condition string  string frequently used parameter marker  mode bw final third conditional test file existence usual format exist filenameext check certain file certain drive thus check certain disk file continuing batch file process pathnames allowed slipandslide let try batch file example illustrate use string comparison make choice batch file work way menu program pretend two software application one word processor named wordexe whose command start word spreadsheet named lotusexe whose command lotus start prepared simple

example remark line begin rem batch file give clue operation program command end result batch file saving keystroke frequently used software word processor spreadsheet could expanded start many software package rem batch file selects one two choice based input rem next line turn screen echo avoid screen clutter echo rem begin test one two choice rem next two line use percent sign marker  w

hold parameter value mentioned however raise limit parameter batch file using single word shift command encountered batch file parameter marker pairing shifted one unit left whatever assigned lost diagram visualize shift command issued parameter marker might dog cat computer shift command would see cat computer notice dog lost becomes computer left vacant unless take new parameter parameter effect shift command wide ranging throughout batch file provide great flexibility range parameter greater ten value  forindo  allows iteration repetition action command command similar  next  step loop programmer use command let repeat action several time command rather subtle could thought three part command syntax variable set command let look closely three part variable set command    part
