packet switching network revised mar contains former file germantxt modified interested compuserve access file transfer packet switching network like found country around world read solved problem downloading compuserve datexp germany jumped meter high finally worked solution applies country also content        quick introduction                      detailed explanation

     interested detail next time enter compuserve via packet switching network logon see  user id  prompt time later also work enter ctrlp hold ctrl key press p talking network instead compuserve enter  set   without quote press return press return second time enter user id continue usual give prompt response ctrl command character like ctrlc ctrlo uninterrupted text uploads disturbing fill character cheaper local pad line editing backspace ctrlu ctrlv mostly clean line online conference important note check network command prefix really ctrlp entering ctrlp nonsense command one return get network error message ctrlp allright get compuserve message like xxxxxx invalid user id try user id ctrlp wrong ask network operator correct network command prefix attention character computer may freeze especially finishing connection type ctrlq hold ctrl press q continue normally see chapter  xmodem file transfer  necessary        detailed explanation                    system connection

similar file transfer facilitated standard setting however completely inadequate especially binary file transfer uploading compuserve difficult downloading pad normally interprets special character

automatically set transparent profile nice instant late thus initial handshaking spoiled file transfer always get stuck fortunately know enough take thing hand control pad compuserve programmer get fixed lazy set parameter individually make use transparent profile network offer germany canada probably many country transparent profile called  prof  start xmodem file transfer go point compuserve approximately one command starting download upload enter ctrlp p dle network command prefix check particular network type  prof  without quote press return press return second time back connection compuserve issue last command start download upload process echo ie nt see typing nt worry carry transfer nt like standard parameter setting set parameter using pset command        please write                        please drop line used information file unsuccessfully successfully update file whenever new knowledge becomes available send sig message since come often use electronic mail would especially like know ctrlp work network prof transparent profile network could upload straight text could download xmodem could upload xmodem could locate error missing information text information
