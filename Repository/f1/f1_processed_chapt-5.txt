lead flow slowly may get variation weight harder lead nt allow enough time lead quit flowing recommend pure soft lead mity mite get alloy antimony smaller caliber nt notice lead coming bleed hole stop swaging figure whether core short let external punch move past bleed hole location happens case need internal punch shorter tail section people assume external punch short making size tends cause
